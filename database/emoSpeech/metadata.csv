bea_amused_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
bea_amused_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
bea_amused_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
bea_amused_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
bea_amused_005|Will we ever forget it.
bea_amused_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
bea_amused_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
bea_amused_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
bea_amused_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
bea_amused_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
bea_amused_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
bea_amused_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
bea_amused_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
bea_amused_015|It's the aurora borealis.
bea_amused_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
bea_amused_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
bea_amused_018|There was a change now.
bea_amused_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
bea_amused_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
bea_amused_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
bea_amused_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
bea_amused_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
bea_amused_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
bea_amused_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
bea_amused_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
bea_amused_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
bea_amused_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
bea_amused_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
bea_amused_030|I had faith in them.
bea_amused_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
bea_amused_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
bea_amused_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
bea_amused_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
bea_amused_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
bea_amused_036|She turned in at the hotel.
bea_amused_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
bea_amused_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
bea_amused_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
bea_amused_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
bea_amused_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
bea_amused_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
bea_amused_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
bea_amused_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
bea_amused_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
bea_amused_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
bea_amused_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
bea_amused_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
bea_amused_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
bea_amused_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
bea_amused_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
bea_amused_052|It was a curious coincidence.
bea_amused_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
bea_amused_054|There was nothing on the rock.
bea_amused_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
bea_amused_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
bea_amused_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
bea_amused_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
bea_amused_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
bea_amused_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
bea_amused_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
bea_amused_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
bea_amused_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
bea_amused_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
bea_amused_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
bea_amused_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
bea_amused_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
bea_amused_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
bea_amused_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
bea_amused_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
bea_amused_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
bea_amused_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
bea_amused_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
bea_amused_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
bea_amused_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
bea_amused_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
bea_amused_079|It was a large canoe.
bea_amused_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
bea_amused_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
bea_amused_082|His face was streaming with blood.
bea_amused_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
bea_amused_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
bea_amused_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
bea_amused_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
bea_amused_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
bea_amused_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
bea_amused_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
bea_amused_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
bea_amused_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
bea_amused_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
bea_amused_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
bea_amused_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
bea_amused_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
bea_amused_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
bea_amused_098|Shall I carry you.
bea_amused_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
bea_amused_100|You must sleep  he urged.
bea_amused_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
bea_amused_102|He will follow us soon.
bea_amused_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
bea_amused_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
bea_amused_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
bea_amused_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
bea_amused_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
bea_amused_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
bea_amused_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
bea_amused_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
bea_amused_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
bea_amused_112|He was wounded in the arm.
bea_amused_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
bea_amused_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
bea_amused_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
bea_amused_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
bea_amused_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
bea_amused_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
bea_amused_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
bea_amused_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
bea_amused_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
bea_amused_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
bea_amused_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
bea_amused_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
bea_amused_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
bea_amused_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
bea_amused_129|Her face was against his breast.
bea_amused_130|She was his now  forever.
bea_amused_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
bea_amused_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
bea_amused_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
bea_amused_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
bea_amused_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
bea_amused_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
bea_amused_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
bea_amused_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
bea_amused_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
bea_amused_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
bea_amused_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
bea_amused_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
bea_amused_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
bea_amused_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
bea_amused_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
bea_amused_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
bea_amused_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
bea_amused_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
bea_amused_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
bea_amused_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
bea_amused_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
bea_amused_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
bea_amused_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
bea_amused_158|Does that look good.
bea_amused_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
bea_amused_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
bea_amused_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
bea_amused_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
bea_amused_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
bea_amused_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
bea_amused_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
bea_amused_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
bea_amused_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
bea_amused_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
bea_amused_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
bea_amused_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
bea_amused_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
bea_amused_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
bea_amused_174|They were the presage of storm.
bea_amused_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
bea_amused_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
bea_amused_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
bea_amused_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
bea_amused_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
bea_amused_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
bea_amused_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
bea_amused_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
bea_amused_183|And the air was growing chilly.
bea_amused_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
bea_amused_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
bea_amused_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
bea_amused_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
bea_amused_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
bea_amused_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
bea_amused_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
bea_amused_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
bea_amused_192|He did not rush in.
bea_amused_193|It was edged with ice.
bea_amused_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
bea_amused_195|But a strange thing happened.
bea_amused_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
bea_amused_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
bea_amused_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
bea_amused_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
bea_amused_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
bea_amused_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
bea_amused_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
bea_amused_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
bea_amused_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
bea_amused_205|From now on we're pals.
bea_amused_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
bea_amused_207|How much was it.
bea_amused_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
bea_amused_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
bea_amused_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
bea_amused_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
bea_amused_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
bea_amused_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
bea_amused_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
bea_amused_215|They die out of spite.
bea_amused_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
bea_amused_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
bea_amused_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
bea_amused_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
bea_amused_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
bea_amused_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
bea_amused_222|What part of the United States is your home.
bea_amused_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
bea_amused_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
bea_amused_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
bea_amused_226|That came before my A B C's.
bea_amused_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
bea_amused_228|But it contributed to the smash.
bea_amused_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
bea_amused_230|Do you know any good land around here.
bea_amused_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
bea_amused_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
bea_amused_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
bea_amused_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
bea_amused_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
bea_amused_236|Don't you see I hate you.
bea_amused_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
bea_amused_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
bea_amused_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
bea_amused_240|Wash your hands of me.
bea_amused_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
bea_amused_242|I saw it when she rolled.
bea_amused_243|I only read the quotations.
bea_amused_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
bea_amused_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
bea_amused_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
bea_amused_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
bea_amused_248|I had been sad too long already.
bea_amused_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
bea_amused_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
bea_amused_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
bea_amused_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
bea_amused_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
bea_amused_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
bea_amused_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
bea_amused_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
bea_amused_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
bea_amused_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
bea_amused_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
bea_amused_261|I have been doubly baptized.
bea_amused_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
bea_amused_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
bea_amused_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
bea_amused_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
bea_amused_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
bea_amused_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
bea_amused_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
bea_amused_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
bea_amused_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
bea_amused_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
bea_amused_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
bea_amused_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
bea_amused_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
bea_amused_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
bea_amused_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
bea_amused_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
bea_amused_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
bea_amused_279|She said with chattering teeth.
bea_amused_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
bea_amused_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
bea_amused_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
bea_amused_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
bea_amused_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
bea_amused_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
bea_amused_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
bea_amused_287|Keep an eye on him.
bea_amused_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
bea_amused_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
bea_amused_290|One by one the boys were captured.
bea_amused_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
bea_amused_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
bea_amused_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
bea_amused_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
bea_amused_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
bea_amused_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
bea_amused_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
bea_amused_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
bea_amused_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
bea_amused_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
bea_amused_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
bea_amused_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
bea_amused_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
bea_amused_304|I graduated last of my class.
bea_amused_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
bea_amused_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
bea_amused_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
bea_amused_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
bea_anger_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
bea_anger_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
bea_anger_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
bea_anger_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
bea_anger_005|Will we ever forget it.
bea_anger_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
bea_anger_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
bea_anger_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
bea_anger_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
bea_anger_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
bea_anger_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
bea_anger_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
bea_anger_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
bea_anger_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
bea_anger_015|It's the aurora borealis.
bea_anger_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
bea_anger_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
bea_anger_018|There was a change now.
bea_anger_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
bea_anger_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
bea_anger_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
bea_anger_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
bea_anger_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
bea_anger_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
bea_anger_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
bea_anger_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
bea_anger_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
bea_anger_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
bea_anger_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
bea_anger_030|I had faith in them.
bea_anger_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
bea_anger_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
bea_anger_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
bea_anger_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
bea_anger_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
bea_anger_036|She turned in at the hotel.
bea_anger_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
bea_anger_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
bea_anger_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
bea_anger_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
bea_anger_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
bea_anger_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
bea_anger_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
bea_anger_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
bea_anger_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.

bea_anger_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
bea_anger_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
bea_anger_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
bea_anger_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
bea_anger_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
bea_anger_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
bea_anger_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
bea_anger_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
bea_anger_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
bea_anger_072|But who was Eileen's double.
bea_anger_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
bea_anger_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
bea_anger_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
bea_anger_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.

bea_anger_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
bea_anger_082|His face was streaming with blood.
bea_anger_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
bea_anger_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
bea_anger_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
bea_anger_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
bea_anger_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
bea_anger_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
bea_anger_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
bea_anger_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
bea_anger_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
bea_anger_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
bea_anger_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
bea_anger_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
bea_anger_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
bea_anger_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
bea_anger_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
bea_anger_098|Shall I carry you.
bea_anger_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
bea_anger_100|You must sleep  he urged.
bea_anger_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
bea_anger_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
bea_anger_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
bea_anger_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
bea_anger_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
bea_anger_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
bea_anger_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
bea_anger_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
bea_anger_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
bea_anger_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
bea_anger_112|He was wounded in the arm.
bea_anger_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
bea_anger_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
bea_anger_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
bea_anger_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
bea_anger_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
bea_anger_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
bea_anger_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
bea_anger_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
bea_anger_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
bea_anger_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
bea_anger_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
bea_anger_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
bea_anger_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
bea_anger_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
bea_anger_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
bea_anger_129|Her face was against his breast.
bea_anger_130|She was his now  forever.
bea_anger_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
bea_anger_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
bea_anger_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
bea_anger_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
bea_anger_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
bea_anger_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
bea_anger_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
bea_anger_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
bea_anger_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
bea_anger_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
bea_anger_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
bea_anger_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
bea_anger_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
bea_anger_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
bea_anger_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
bea_anger_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
bea_anger_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
bea_anger_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
bea_anger_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
bea_anger_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
bea_anger_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
bea_anger_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
bea_anger_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
bea_anger_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
bea_anger_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
bea_anger_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
bea_anger_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
bea_anger_158|Does that look good.
bea_anger_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
bea_anger_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
bea_anger_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
bea_anger_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
bea_anger_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
bea_anger_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
bea_anger_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
bea_anger_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
bea_anger_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
bea_anger_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
bea_anger_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
bea_anger_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
bea_anger_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
bea_anger_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
bea_anger_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
bea_anger_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
bea_anger_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
bea_anger_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
bea_anger_205|From now on we're pals.
bea_anger_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
bea_anger_207|How much was it.
bea_anger_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
bea_anger_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
bea_anger_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
bea_anger_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
bea_anger_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
bea_anger_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
bea_anger_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
bea_anger_215|They die out of spite.
bea_anger_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
bea_anger_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
bea_anger_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
bea_anger_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
bea_anger_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
bea_anger_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
bea_anger_222|What part of the United States is your home.
bea_anger_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
bea_anger_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
bea_anger_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
bea_anger_226|That came before my A B C's.
bea_anger_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
bea_anger_228|But it contributed to the smash.
bea_anger_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
bea_anger_230|Do you know any good land around here.
bea_anger_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
bea_anger_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
bea_anger_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
bea_anger_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
bea_anger_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
bea_anger_236|Don't you see I hate you.
bea_anger_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
bea_anger_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
bea_anger_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
bea_anger_240|Wash your hands of me.
bea_anger_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
bea_anger_242|I saw it when she rolled.
bea_anger_243|I only read the quotations.
bea_anger_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
bea_anger_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
bea_anger_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
bea_anger_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
bea_anger_248|I had been sad too long already.
bea_anger_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
bea_anger_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
bea_anger_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
bea_anger_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
bea_anger_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
bea_anger_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
bea_anger_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
bea_anger_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
bea_anger_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
bea_anger_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
bea_anger_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
bea_anger_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
bea_anger_261|I have been doubly baptized.
bea_anger_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
bea_anger_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
bea_anger_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
bea_anger_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
bea_anger_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
bea_anger_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
bea_anger_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
bea_anger_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
bea_anger_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
bea_anger_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
bea_anger_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
bea_anger_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
bea_anger_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
bea_anger_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
bea_anger_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
bea_anger_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
bea_anger_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
bea_anger_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
bea_anger_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
bea_anger_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
bea_anger_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
bea_anger_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
bea_anger_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
bea_anger_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
bea_anger_287|Keep an eye on him.
bea_anger_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
bea_anger_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
bea_anger_290|One by one the boys were captured.
bea_anger_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
bea_anger_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
bea_anger_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
bea_anger_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
bea_anger_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
bea_anger_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
bea_anger_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
bea_anger_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
bea_anger_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
bea_anger_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
bea_anger_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
bea_anger_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
bea_anger_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
bea_anger_304|I graduated last of my class.
bea_anger_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
bea_anger_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
bea_anger_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
bea_anger_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
bea_anger_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
bea_anger_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
bea_anger_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
bea_anger_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
bea_anger_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
bea_anger_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
bea_anger_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
bea_anger_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
bea_anger_317|He was a wise hyena.
bea_anger_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
bea_anger_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
bea_anger_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
bea_anger_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
bea_anger_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
bea_anger_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
bea_anger_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
bea_anger_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
bea_anger_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
bea_anger_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
bea_anger_329|Ah  indeed.
bea_anger_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
bea_anger_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
bea_anger_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
bea_anger_333|This is no place for you.
bea_anger_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
bea_anger_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
bea_anger_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
bea_disgust_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
bea_disgust_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
bea_disgust_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
bea_disgust_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
bea_disgust_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
bea_disgust_015|It's the aurora borealis.
bea_disgust_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
bea_disgust_018|There was a change now.
bea_disgust_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
bea_disgust_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
bea_disgust_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
bea_disgust_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
bea_disgust_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
bea_disgust_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
bea_disgust_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
bea_disgust_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
bea_disgust_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
bea_disgust_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
bea_disgust_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
bea_disgust_030|I had faith in them.
bea_disgust_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
bea_disgust_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
bea_disgust_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
bea_disgust_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
bea_disgust_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
bea_disgust_036|She turned in at the hotel.
bea_disgust_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
bea_disgust_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
bea_disgust_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
bea_disgust_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
bea_disgust_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
bea_disgust_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
bea_disgust_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
bea_disgust_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
bea_disgust_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
bea_disgust_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
bea_disgust_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
bea_disgust_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
bea_disgust_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
bea_disgust_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
bea_disgust_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
bea_disgust_052|It was a curious coincidence.
bea_disgust_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
bea_disgust_054|There was nothing on the rock.
bea_disgust_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
bea_disgust_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
bea_disgust_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
bea_disgust_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
bea_disgust_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
bea_disgust_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
bea_disgust_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
bea_disgust_062|The men stared into each other's face.
bea_disgust_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
bea_disgust_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
bea_disgust_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
bea_disgust_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
bea_disgust_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
bea_disgust_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
bea_disgust_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
bea_disgust_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
bea_disgust_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
bea_disgust_072|But who was Eileen's double.
bea_disgust_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
bea_disgust_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
bea_disgust_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
bea_disgust_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
bea_disgust_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
bea_disgust_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
bea_disgust_079|It was a large canoe.
bea_disgust_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
bea_disgust_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
bea_disgust_082|His face was streaming with blood.
bea_disgust_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
bea_disgust_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
bea_disgust_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
bea_disgust_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
bea_disgust_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
bea_disgust_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
bea_disgust_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
bea_disgust_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
bea_disgust_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
bea_disgust_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
bea_disgust_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
bea_disgust_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
bea_disgust_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
bea_disgust_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
bea_disgust_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
bea_disgust_098|Shall I carry you.
bea_disgust_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
bea_disgust_100|You must sleep  he urged.
bea_disgust_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
bea_disgust_102|He will follow us soon.
bea_disgust_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
bea_disgust_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
bea_disgust_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
bea_disgust_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
bea_disgust_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
bea_disgust_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
bea_disgust_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
bea_disgust_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
bea_disgust_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
bea_disgust_112|He was wounded in the arm.
bea_disgust_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
bea_disgust_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
bea_disgust_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
bea_disgust_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
bea_disgust_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
bea_disgust_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
bea_disgust_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
bea_disgust_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
bea_disgust_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
bea_disgust_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.

bea_disgust_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
bea_disgust_129|Her face was against his breast.
bea_disgust_130|She was his now  forever.
bea_disgust_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
bea_disgust_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
bea_disgust_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
bea_disgust_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
bea_disgust_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
bea_disgust_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
bea_disgust_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.

bea_disgust_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
bea_disgust_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
bea_disgust_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
bea_disgust_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
bea_disgust_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
bea_disgust_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
bea_disgust_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
bea_disgust_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
bea_disgust_158|Does that look good.
bea_disgust_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
bea_disgust_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
bea_disgust_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
bea_disgust_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
bea_disgust_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
bea_disgust_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
bea_disgust_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
bea_disgust_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
bea_disgust_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
bea_disgust_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
bea_disgust_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
bea_disgust_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
bea_disgust_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
bea_disgust_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
bea_disgust_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
bea_disgust_174|They were the presage of storm.
bea_disgust_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
bea_disgust_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
bea_disgust_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
bea_disgust_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
bea_disgust_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
bea_disgust_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
bea_disgust_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
bea_disgust_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
bea_disgust_183|And the air was growing chilly.
bea_disgust_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
bea_disgust_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
bea_disgust_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
bea_disgust_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
bea_disgust_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
bea_disgust_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
bea_disgust_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
bea_disgust_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
bea_disgust_192|He did not rush in.
bea_disgust_193|It was edged with ice.
bea_disgust_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
bea_disgust_195|But a strange thing happened.
bea_disgust_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
bea_disgust_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
bea_disgust_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
bea_disgust_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
bea_disgust_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
bea_disgust_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
bea_disgust_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
bea_disgust_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
bea_disgust_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
bea_disgust_205|From now on we're pals.
bea_disgust_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
bea_disgust_207|How much was it.
bea_disgust_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
bea_disgust_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
bea_disgust_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
bea_disgust_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
bea_disgust_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
bea_disgust_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
bea_disgust_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
bea_disgust_215|They die out of spite.
bea_disgust_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
bea_disgust_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
bea_disgust_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
bea_disgust_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
bea_disgust_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
bea_disgust_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
bea_disgust_222|What part of the United States is your home.
bea_disgust_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
bea_disgust_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
bea_disgust_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
bea_disgust_226|That came before my A B C's.
bea_disgust_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
bea_disgust_228|But it contributed to the smash.
bea_disgust_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
bea_disgust_230|Do you know any good land around here.
bea_disgust_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
bea_disgust_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
bea_disgust_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
bea_disgust_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
bea_disgust_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
bea_disgust_236|Don't you see I hate you.
bea_disgust_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
bea_disgust_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
bea_disgust_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
bea_disgust_240|Wash your hands of me.
bea_disgust_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
bea_disgust_242|I saw it when she rolled.
bea_disgust_243|I only read the quotations.
bea_disgust_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
bea_disgust_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
bea_disgust_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
bea_disgust_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
bea_disgust_248|I had been sad too long already.
bea_disgust_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
bea_disgust_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
bea_disgust_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
bea_disgust_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
bea_disgust_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
bea_disgust_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
bea_disgust_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
bea_disgust_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
bea_disgust_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
bea_disgust_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
bea_disgust_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
bea_disgust_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
bea_disgust_261|I have been doubly baptized.
bea_disgust_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
bea_disgust_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
bea_disgust_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
bea_disgust_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
bea_disgust_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
bea_disgust_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
bea_disgust_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
bea_disgust_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
bea_disgust_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
bea_disgust_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
bea_disgust_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
bea_disgust_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
bea_disgust_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
bea_disgust_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
bea_disgust_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
bea_disgust_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
bea_disgust_279|She said with chattering teeth.
bea_disgust_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
bea_disgust_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
bea_disgust_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
bea_disgust_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
bea_disgust_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
bea_disgust_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
bea_disgust_287|Keep an eye on him.
bea_disgust_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
bea_disgust_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
bea_disgust_290|One by one the boys were captured.
bea_disgust_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
bea_disgust_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
bea_disgust_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
bea_disgust_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
bea_disgust_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
bea_disgust_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
bea_disgust_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
bea_disgust_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
bea_disgust_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
bea_disgust_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
bea_disgust_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
bea_disgust_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
bea_disgust_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
bea_disgust_304|I graduated last of my class.
bea_disgust_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
bea_disgust_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
bea_disgust_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
bea_disgust_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
bea_disgust_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
bea_disgust_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
bea_disgust_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
bea_disgust_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
bea_disgust_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
bea_disgust_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
bea_disgust_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
bea_disgust_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
bea_disgust_317|He was a wise hyena.
bea_disgust_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
bea_disgust_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
bea_disgust_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
bea_disgust_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
bea_disgust_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
bea_disgust_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
bea_disgust_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
bea_disgust_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
bea_disgust_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
bea_disgust_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
bea_disgust_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
bea_disgust_329|Ah  indeed.
bea_disgust_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
bea_disgust_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
bea_disgust_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
bea_disgust_333|This is no place for you.
bea_disgust_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
bea_disgust_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
bea_disgust_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
bea_neutral_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
bea_neutral_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
bea_neutral_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
bea_neutral_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
bea_neutral_005|Will we ever forget it.
bea_neutral_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
bea_neutral_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
bea_neutral_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
bea_neutral_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
bea_neutral_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
bea_neutral_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
bea_neutral_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
bea_neutral_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
bea_neutral_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
bea_neutral_015|It's the aurora borealis.
bea_neutral_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
bea_neutral_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
bea_neutral_018|There was a change now.
bea_neutral_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
bea_neutral_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
bea_neutral_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
bea_neutral_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
bea_neutral_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
bea_neutral_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
bea_neutral_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
bea_neutral_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
bea_neutral_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
bea_neutral_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
bea_neutral_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
bea_neutral_030|I had faith in them.
bea_neutral_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
bea_neutral_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
bea_neutral_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
bea_neutral_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
bea_neutral_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
bea_neutral_036|She turned in at the hotel.
bea_neutral_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
bea_neutral_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
bea_neutral_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
bea_neutral_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
bea_neutral_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
bea_neutral_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
bea_neutral_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
bea_neutral_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
bea_neutral_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
bea_neutral_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
bea_neutral_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
bea_neutral_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
bea_neutral_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
bea_neutral_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
bea_neutral_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
bea_neutral_052|It was a curious coincidence.
bea_neutral_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
bea_neutral_054|There was nothing on the rock.
bea_neutral_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
bea_neutral_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
bea_neutral_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
bea_neutral_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
bea_neutral_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
bea_neutral_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
bea_neutral_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
bea_neutral_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
bea_neutral_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
bea_neutral_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
bea_neutral_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
bea_neutral_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
bea_neutral_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
bea_neutral_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
bea_neutral_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
bea_neutral_072|But who was Eileen's double.
bea_neutral_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
bea_neutral_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
bea_neutral_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
bea_neutral_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
bea_neutral_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
bea_neutral_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
bea_neutral_079|It was a large canoe.
bea_neutral_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
bea_neutral_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
bea_neutral_082|His face was streaming with blood.
bea_neutral_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
bea_neutral_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
bea_neutral_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
bea_neutral_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
bea_neutral_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
bea_neutral_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
bea_neutral_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
bea_neutral_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
bea_neutral_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
bea_neutral_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
bea_neutral_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
bea_neutral_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
bea_neutral_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
bea_neutral_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
bea_neutral_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
bea_neutral_098|Shall I carry you.
bea_neutral_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
bea_neutral_100|You must sleep  he urged.
bea_neutral_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
bea_neutral_102|He will follow us soon.
bea_neutral_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
bea_neutral_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
bea_neutral_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
bea_neutral_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
bea_neutral_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
bea_neutral_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
bea_neutral_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
bea_neutral_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
bea_neutral_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
bea_neutral_112|He was wounded in the arm.
bea_neutral_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
bea_neutral_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
bea_neutral_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
bea_neutral_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
bea_neutral_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
bea_neutral_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
bea_neutral_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
bea_neutral_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
bea_neutral_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
bea_neutral_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
bea_neutral_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
bea_neutral_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
bea_neutral_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
bea_neutral_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
bea_neutral_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
bea_neutral_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
bea_neutral_129|Her face was against his breast.
bea_neutral_130|She was his now  forever.
bea_neutral_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
bea_neutral_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
bea_neutral_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
bea_neutral_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
bea_neutral_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
bea_neutral_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
bea_neutral_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
bea_neutral_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
bea_neutral_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
bea_neutral_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
bea_neutral_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
bea_neutral_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
bea_neutral_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
bea_neutral_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
bea_neutral_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
bea_neutral_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
bea_neutral_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
bea_neutral_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
bea_neutral_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
bea_neutral_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
bea_neutral_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
bea_neutral_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
bea_neutral_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
bea_neutral_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
bea_neutral_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
bea_neutral_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
bea_neutral_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
bea_neutral_158|Does that look good.
bea_neutral_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
bea_neutral_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
bea_neutral_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
bea_neutral_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
bea_neutral_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
bea_neutral_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
bea_neutral_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
bea_neutral_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
bea_neutral_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
bea_neutral_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
bea_neutral_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
bea_neutral_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
bea_neutral_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
bea_neutral_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
bea_neutral_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
bea_neutral_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
bea_neutral_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
bea_neutral_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
bea_neutral_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
bea_neutral_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
bea_neutral_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
bea_neutral_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
bea_neutral_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
bea_neutral_183|And the air was growing chilly.
bea_neutral_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
bea_neutral_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
bea_neutral_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
bea_neutral_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
bea_neutral_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
bea_neutral_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
bea_neutral_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
bea_neutral_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
bea_neutral_192|He did not rush in.
bea_neutral_193|It was edged with ice.
bea_neutral_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
bea_neutral_195|But a strange thing happened.
bea_neutral_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
bea_neutral_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
bea_neutral_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
bea_neutral_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
bea_neutral_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
bea_neutral_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
bea_neutral_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
bea_neutral_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
bea_neutral_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
bea_neutral_205|From now on we're pals.
bea_neutral_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
bea_neutral_207|How much was it.
bea_neutral_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
bea_neutral_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
bea_neutral_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
bea_neutral_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
bea_neutral_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
bea_neutral_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
bea_neutral_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
bea_neutral_215|They die out of spite.
bea_neutral_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
bea_neutral_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
bea_neutral_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
bea_neutral_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
bea_neutral_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
bea_neutral_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
bea_neutral_222|What part of the United States is your home.
bea_neutral_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
bea_neutral_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
bea_neutral_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
bea_neutral_226|That came before my A B C's.
bea_neutral_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
bea_neutral_228|But it contributed to the smash.
bea_neutral_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
bea_neutral_230|Do you know any good land around here.
bea_neutral_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
bea_neutral_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
bea_neutral_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
bea_neutral_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
bea_neutral_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
bea_neutral_236|Don't you see I hate you.
bea_neutral_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
bea_neutral_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
bea_neutral_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
bea_neutral_240|Wash your hands of me.
bea_neutral_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
bea_neutral_243|I only read the quotations.
bea_neutral_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
bea_neutral_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
bea_neutral_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
bea_neutral_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
bea_neutral_248|I had been sad too long already.
bea_neutral_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
bea_neutral_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
bea_neutral_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
bea_neutral_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
bea_neutral_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
bea_neutral_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
bea_neutral_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
bea_neutral_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
bea_neutral_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
bea_neutral_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
bea_neutral_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
bea_neutral_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
bea_neutral_261|I have been doubly baptized.
bea_neutral_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
bea_neutral_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
bea_neutral_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
bea_neutral_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
bea_neutral_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
bea_neutral_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
bea_neutral_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
bea_neutral_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
bea_neutral_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
bea_neutral_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
bea_neutral_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
bea_neutral_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
bea_neutral_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
bea_neutral_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
bea_neutral_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
bea_neutral_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
bea_neutral_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
bea_neutral_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
bea_neutral_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
bea_neutral_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
bea_neutral_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
bea_neutral_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
bea_neutral_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
bea_neutral_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
bea_neutral_287|Keep an eye on him.
bea_neutral_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
bea_neutral_290|One by one the boys were captured.
bea_neutral_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
bea_neutral_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
bea_neutral_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
bea_neutral_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
bea_neutral_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
bea_neutral_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
bea_neutral_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
bea_neutral_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
bea_neutral_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
bea_neutral_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
bea_neutral_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
bea_neutral_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
bea_neutral_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
bea_neutral_304|I graduated last of my class.
bea_neutral_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
bea_neutral_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
bea_neutral_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
bea_neutral_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
bea_neutral_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
bea_neutral_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
bea_neutral_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
bea_neutral_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
bea_neutral_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
bea_neutral_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
bea_neutral_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
bea_neutral_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
bea_neutral_317|He was a wise hyena.
bea_neutral_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
bea_neutral_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
bea_neutral_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
bea_neutral_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
bea_neutral_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
bea_neutral_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
bea_neutral_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
bea_neutral_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
bea_neutral_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
bea_neutral_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
bea_neutral_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
bea_neutral_329|Ah  indeed.
bea_neutral_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
bea_neutral_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
bea_neutral_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
bea_neutral_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
bea_neutral_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
bea_neutral_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
bea_neutral_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
bea_neutral_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
bea_neutral_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
bea_neutral_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
bea_neutral_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
bea_neutral_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
bea_neutral_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
bea_neutral_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
bea_neutral_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
bea_neutral_346|Get down and dig in.
bea_neutral_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
bea_neutral_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
bea_neutral_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
bea_neutral_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
bea_neutral_351|It was more like sugar.
bea_neutral_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
bea_neutral_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
bea_neutral_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
bea_neutral_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
bea_neutral_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
bea_neutral_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
bea_neutral_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
bea_neutral_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
bea_neutral_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
bea_neutral_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
bea_neutral_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
bea_neutral_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
bea_neutral_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
bea_sleepiness_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
bea_sleepiness_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
bea_sleepiness_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
bea_sleepiness_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
bea_sleepiness_005|Will we ever forget it.
bea_sleepiness_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
bea_sleepiness_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
bea_sleepiness_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
bea_sleepiness_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
bea_sleepiness_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
bea_sleepiness_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
bea_sleepiness_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
bea_sleepiness_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
bea_sleepiness_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
bea_sleepiness_015|It's the aurora borealis.
bea_sleepiness_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
bea_sleepiness_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
bea_sleepiness_018|There was a change now.
bea_sleepiness_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
bea_sleepiness_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
bea_sleepiness_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
bea_sleepiness_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
bea_sleepiness_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
bea_sleepiness_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
bea_sleepiness_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
bea_sleepiness_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
bea_sleepiness_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
bea_sleepiness_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
bea_sleepiness_030|I had faith in them.
bea_sleepiness_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
bea_sleepiness_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
bea_sleepiness_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
bea_sleepiness_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
bea_sleepiness_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
bea_sleepiness_036|She turned in at the hotel.
bea_sleepiness_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
bea_sleepiness_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
bea_sleepiness_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
bea_sleepiness_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
bea_sleepiness_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
bea_sleepiness_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
bea_sleepiness_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
bea_sleepiness_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
bea_sleepiness_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
bea_sleepiness_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
bea_sleepiness_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
bea_sleepiness_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
bea_sleepiness_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
bea_sleepiness_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
bea_sleepiness_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
bea_sleepiness_052|It was a curious coincidence.
bea_sleepiness_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
bea_sleepiness_054|There was nothing on the rock.
bea_sleepiness_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
bea_sleepiness_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
bea_sleepiness_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
bea_sleepiness_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
bea_sleepiness_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
bea_sleepiness_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
bea_sleepiness_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
bea_sleepiness_062|The men stared into each other's face.
bea_sleepiness_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
bea_sleepiness_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
bea_sleepiness_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
bea_sleepiness_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
bea_sleepiness_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
bea_sleepiness_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
bea_sleepiness_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
bea_sleepiness_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
bea_sleepiness_072|But who was Eileen's double.
bea_sleepiness_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
bea_sleepiness_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
bea_sleepiness_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
bea_sleepiness_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
bea_sleepiness_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
bea_sleepiness_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
bea_sleepiness_079|It was a large canoe.
bea_sleepiness_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
bea_sleepiness_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
bea_sleepiness_082|His face was streaming with blood.
bea_sleepiness_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
bea_sleepiness_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
bea_sleepiness_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
bea_sleepiness_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
bea_sleepiness_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
bea_sleepiness_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
bea_sleepiness_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
bea_sleepiness_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
bea_sleepiness_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
bea_sleepiness_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
bea_sleepiness_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
bea_sleepiness_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
bea_sleepiness_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
bea_sleepiness_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
bea_sleepiness_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
bea_sleepiness_098|Shall I carry you.
bea_sleepiness_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
bea_sleepiness_100|You must sleep  he urged.
bea_sleepiness_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
bea_sleepiness_102|He will follow us soon.
bea_sleepiness_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
bea_sleepiness_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
bea_sleepiness_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
bea_sleepiness_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
bea_sleepiness_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
bea_sleepiness_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
bea_sleepiness_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
bea_sleepiness_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
bea_sleepiness_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
bea_sleepiness_112|He was wounded in the arm.
bea_sleepiness_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
bea_sleepiness_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
bea_sleepiness_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
bea_sleepiness_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
bea_sleepiness_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
bea_sleepiness_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
bea_sleepiness_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
bea_sleepiness_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
bea_sleepiness_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
bea_sleepiness_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
bea_sleepiness_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
bea_sleepiness_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
bea_sleepiness_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
bea_sleepiness_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
bea_sleepiness_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
bea_sleepiness_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
bea_sleepiness_129|Her face was against his breast.
bea_sleepiness_130|She was his now  forever.
bea_sleepiness_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
bea_sleepiness_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
bea_sleepiness_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
bea_sleepiness_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
bea_sleepiness_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
bea_sleepiness_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
bea_sleepiness_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
bea_sleepiness_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
bea_sleepiness_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
bea_sleepiness_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
bea_sleepiness_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
bea_sleepiness_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
bea_sleepiness_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
bea_sleepiness_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
bea_sleepiness_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
bea_sleepiness_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
bea_sleepiness_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
bea_sleepiness_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
bea_sleepiness_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
bea_sleepiness_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
bea_sleepiness_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
bea_sleepiness_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
bea_sleepiness_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
bea_sleepiness_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
bea_sleepiness_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
bea_sleepiness_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
bea_sleepiness_158|Does that look good.
bea_sleepiness_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
bea_sleepiness_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
bea_sleepiness_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
bea_sleepiness_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
bea_sleepiness_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
bea_sleepiness_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
bea_sleepiness_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
bea_sleepiness_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
bea_sleepiness_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
bea_sleepiness_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
bea_sleepiness_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
bea_sleepiness_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
bea_sleepiness_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
bea_sleepiness_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
bea_sleepiness_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
bea_sleepiness_174|They were the presage of storm.
bea_sleepiness_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
bea_sleepiness_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
bea_sleepiness_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
bea_sleepiness_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
bea_sleepiness_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
bea_sleepiness_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
bea_sleepiness_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
bea_sleepiness_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
bea_sleepiness_183|And the air was growing chilly.
bea_sleepiness_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
bea_sleepiness_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
bea_sleepiness_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
bea_sleepiness_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
bea_sleepiness_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
bea_sleepiness_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
bea_sleepiness_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
bea_sleepiness_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
bea_sleepiness_192|He did not rush in.
bea_sleepiness_193|It was edged with ice.
bea_sleepiness_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
bea_sleepiness_195|But a strange thing happened.
bea_sleepiness_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
bea_sleepiness_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
bea_sleepiness_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
bea_sleepiness_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
bea_sleepiness_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
bea_sleepiness_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
bea_sleepiness_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
bea_sleepiness_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
bea_sleepiness_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
bea_sleepiness_205|From now on we're pals.
bea_sleepiness_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
bea_sleepiness_207|How much was it.
bea_sleepiness_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
bea_sleepiness_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
bea_sleepiness_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
bea_sleepiness_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
bea_sleepiness_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
bea_sleepiness_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
bea_sleepiness_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
bea_sleepiness_215|They die out of spite.
bea_sleepiness_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
bea_sleepiness_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
bea_sleepiness_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
bea_sleepiness_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
bea_sleepiness_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
bea_sleepiness_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
bea_sleepiness_222|What part of the United States is your home.
bea_sleepiness_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
bea_sleepiness_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
bea_sleepiness_226|That came before my A B C's.
bea_sleepiness_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
bea_sleepiness_228|But it contributed to the smash.
bea_sleepiness_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
bea_sleepiness_230|Do you know any good land around here.
bea_sleepiness_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
bea_sleepiness_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
bea_sleepiness_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
bea_sleepiness_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
bea_sleepiness_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
bea_sleepiness_236|Don't you see I hate you.
bea_sleepiness_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
bea_sleepiness_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
bea_sleepiness_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
bea_sleepiness_240|Wash your hands of me.
bea_sleepiness_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
bea_sleepiness_242|I saw it when she rolled.
bea_sleepiness_243|I only read the quotations.
bea_sleepiness_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
bea_sleepiness_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
bea_sleepiness_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
bea_sleepiness_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
bea_sleepiness_248|I had been sad too long already.
bea_sleepiness_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
bea_sleepiness_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
bea_sleepiness_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
bea_sleepiness_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
bea_sleepiness_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
bea_sleepiness_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
bea_sleepiness_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
bea_sleepiness_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
bea_sleepiness_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
bea_sleepiness_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
bea_sleepiness_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
bea_sleepiness_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
bea_sleepiness_261|I have been doubly baptized.
bea_sleepiness_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
bea_sleepiness_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
bea_sleepiness_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
bea_sleepiness_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
bea_sleepiness_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
bea_sleepiness_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
bea_sleepiness_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
bea_sleepiness_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
bea_sleepiness_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
bea_sleepiness_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
bea_sleepiness_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
bea_sleepiness_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
bea_sleepiness_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
bea_sleepiness_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
bea_sleepiness_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
bea_sleepiness_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
bea_sleepiness_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
bea_sleepiness_279|She said with chattering teeth.
bea_sleepiness_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
bea_sleepiness_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
bea_sleepiness_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
bea_sleepiness_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
bea_sleepiness_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
bea_sleepiness_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
bea_sleepiness_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
bea_sleepiness_287|Keep an eye on him.
bea_sleepiness_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
bea_sleepiness_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
bea_sleepiness_290|One by one the boys were captured.
bea_sleepiness_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
bea_sleepiness_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
bea_sleepiness_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
bea_sleepiness_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
bea_sleepiness_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
bea_sleepiness_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
bea_sleepiness_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
bea_sleepiness_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
bea_sleepiness_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
bea_sleepiness_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
bea_sleepiness_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
bea_sleepiness_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
bea_sleepiness_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
bea_sleepiness_304|I graduated last of my class.
bea_sleepiness_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
bea_sleepiness_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
bea_sleepiness_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
bea_sleepiness_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
bea_sleepiness_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
bea_sleepiness_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
bea_sleepiness_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
bea_sleepiness_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
bea_sleepiness_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
bea_sleepiness_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
bea_sleepiness_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
bea_sleepiness_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
bea_sleepiness_317|He was a wise hyena.
bea_sleepiness_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
bea_sleepiness_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
bea_sleepiness_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
bea_sleepiness_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
bea_sleepiness_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
bea_sleepiness_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
bea_sleepiness_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
bea_sleepiness_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
bea_sleepiness_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
bea_sleepiness_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
bea_sleepiness_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
bea_sleepiness_329|Ah  indeed.
bea_sleepiness_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
bea_sleepiness_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
bea_sleepiness_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
bea_sleepiness_333|This is no place for you.
bea_sleepiness_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
bea_sleepiness_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
bea_sleepiness_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
bea_sleepiness_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
bea_sleepiness_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
bea_sleepiness_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
bea_sleepiness_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
bea_sleepiness_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
bea_sleepiness_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
bea_sleepiness_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
bea_sleepiness_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
bea_sleepiness_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
bea_sleepiness_346|Get down and dig in.
bea_sleepiness_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
bea_sleepiness_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
bea_sleepiness_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
bea_sleepiness_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
bea_sleepiness_351|It was more like sugar.
bea_sleepiness_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
bea_sleepiness_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
bea_sleepiness_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
bea_sleepiness_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
bea_sleepiness_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
bea_sleepiness_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
bea_sleepiness_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
bea_sleepiness_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
bea_sleepiness_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
bea_sleepiness_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
bea_sleepiness_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
bea_sleepiness_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
bea_sleepiness_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
bea_sleepiness_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
bea_sleepiness_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
bea_sleepiness_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
bea_sleepiness_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
bea_sleepiness_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
bea_sleepiness_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
bea_sleepiness_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
bea_sleepiness_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
bea_sleepiness_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
bea_sleepiness_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
bea_sleepiness_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
bea_sleepiness_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
bea_sleepiness_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
bea_sleepiness_379|How old are you  daddy.
bea_sleepiness_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
bea_sleepiness_381|My name's Ferguson.
bea_sleepiness_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
bea_sleepiness_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
bea_sleepiness_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
bea_sleepiness_385|That's what Carnegie did.
bea_sleepiness_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
bea_sleepiness_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
bea_sleepiness_388|It was my idea to a tee.
bea_sleepiness_389|Mab  she said.
bea_sleepiness_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
bea_sleepiness_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
bea_sleepiness_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
bea_sleepiness_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
bea_sleepiness_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
bea_sleepiness_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
bea_sleepiness_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
bea_sleepiness_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
bea_sleepiness_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
bea_sleepiness_399|And here's another idea.
bea_sleepiness_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
bea_sleepiness_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
bea_sleepiness_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
bea_sleepiness_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
bea_sleepiness_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
bea_sleepiness_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
bea_sleepiness_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
bea_sleepiness_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
bea_sleepiness_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
bea_sleepiness_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
bea_sleepiness_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
bea_sleepiness_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
bea_sleepiness_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
bea_sleepiness_414|Now our figuring was all right.
bea_sleepiness_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
bea_sleepiness_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
bea_sleepiness_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
bea_sleepiness_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
bea_sleepiness_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
bea_sleepiness_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
bea_sleepiness_421|By golly  the boy wins.
bea_sleepiness_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
bea_sleepiness_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
bea_sleepiness_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
bea_sleepiness_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
bea_sleepiness_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
bea_sleepiness_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
bea_sleepiness_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
bea_sleepiness_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
bea_sleepiness_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
bea_sleepiness_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
bea_sleepiness_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
bea_sleepiness_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
bea_sleepiness_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
bea_sleepiness_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
bea_sleepiness_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
bea_sleepiness_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
bea_sleepiness_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
bea_sleepiness_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
bea_sleepiness_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
bea_sleepiness_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
bea_sleepiness_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
bea_sleepiness_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
bea_sleepiness_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
bea_sleepiness_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
bea_sleepiness_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
bea_sleepiness_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
bea_sleepiness_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
bea_sleepiness_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
bea_sleepiness_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
bea_sleepiness_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
bea_sleepiness_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
bea_sleepiness_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
bea_sleepiness_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
bea_sleepiness_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
bea_sleepiness_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
bea_sleepiness_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
bea_sleepiness_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
bea_sleepiness_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
bea_sleepiness_460|I had forgotten their existence.
bea_sleepiness_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
bea_sleepiness_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
bea_sleepiness_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
bea_sleepiness_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
bea_sleepiness_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
bea_sleepiness_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
bea_sleepiness_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
bea_sleepiness_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
bea_sleepiness_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
bea_sleepiness_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
bea_sleepiness_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
bea_sleepiness_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
bea_sleepiness_473|The night was calm and snowy.
bea_sleepiness_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
bea_sleepiness_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
bea_sleepiness_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
bea_sleepiness_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
bea_sleepiness_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
bea_sleepiness_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
bea_sleepiness_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
bea_sleepiness_481|Nimrod replied  with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
bea_sleepiness_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
bea_sleepiness_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
bea_sleepiness_484|No-sir-ee.
bea_sleepiness_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
bea_sleepiness_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
bea_sleepiness_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
bea_sleepiness_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
bea_sleepiness_489|They were artists  not biologists.
bea_sleepiness_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
bea_sleepiness_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
bea_sleepiness_493|The boy  O'Brien  was specially maltreated.
bea_sleepiness_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
bea_sleepiness_495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
bea_sleepiness_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
bea_sleepiness_497|King took every advantage he knew.
bea_sleepiness_498|The lines were now very taut.
bea_sleepiness_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
bea_sleepiness_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
bea_sleepiness_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
bea_sleepiness_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
bea_sleepiness_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
bea_sleepiness_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
jen_amused_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
jen_amused_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
jen_amused_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
jen_amused_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
jen_amused_005|Will we ever forget it.
jen_amused_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
jen_amused_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
jen_amused_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
jen_amused_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
jen_amused_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
jen_amused_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
jen_amused_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
jen_amused_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
jen_amused_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
jen_amused_015|It's the aurora borealis.
jen_amused_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
jen_amused_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
jen_amused_018|There was a change now.
jen_amused_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
jen_amused_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
jen_amused_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
jen_amused_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
jen_amused_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
jen_amused_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
jen_amused_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
jen_amused_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
jen_amused_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
jen_amused_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
jen_amused_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
jen_amused_030|I had faith in them.
jen_amused_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
jen_amused_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
jen_amused_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
jen_amused_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
jen_amused_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
jen_amused_036|She turned in at the hotel.
jen_amused_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
jen_amused_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
jen_amused_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
jen_amused_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
jen_amused_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
jen_amused_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
jen_amused_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
jen_amused_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
jen_amused_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
jen_amused_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
jen_amused_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
jen_amused_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
jen_amused_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
jen_amused_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
jen_amused_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
jen_amused_052|It was a curious coincidence.
jen_amused_054|There was nothing on the rock.
jen_amused_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
jen_amused_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
jen_amused_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
jen_amused_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
jen_amused_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
jen_amused_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
jen_amused_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
jen_amused_062|The men stared into each other's face.
jen_amused_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
jen_amused_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
jen_amused_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
jen_amused_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
jen_amused_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
jen_amused_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
jen_amused_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
jen_amused_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
jen_amused_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
jen_amused_072|But who was Eileen's double.
jen_amused_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
jen_amused_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
jen_amused_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
jen_amused_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
jen_amused_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
jen_amused_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
jen_amused_079|It was a large canoe.
jen_amused_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
jen_amused_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
jen_amused_082|His face was streaming with blood.
jen_amused_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
jen_amused_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
jen_amused_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
jen_amused_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
jen_amused_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
jen_amused_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
jen_amused_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
jen_amused_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
jen_amused_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
jen_amused_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
jen_amused_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
jen_amused_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
jen_amused_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
jen_amused_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
jen_amused_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
jen_amused_098|Shall I carry you.
jen_amused_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
jen_amused_100|You must sleep  he urged.
jen_amused_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
jen_amused_102|He will follow us soon.
jen_amused_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
jen_amused_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
jen_amused_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
jen_amused_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
jen_amused_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
jen_amused_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
jen_amused_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
jen_amused_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
jen_amused_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
jen_amused_112|He was wounded in the arm.
jen_amused_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
jen_amused_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
jen_amused_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
jen_amused_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
jen_amused_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
jen_amused_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
jen_amused_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
jen_amused_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
jen_amused_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
jen_amused_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
jen_amused_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
jen_amused_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
jen_amused_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
jen_amused_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
jen_amused_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
jen_amused_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
jen_amused_129|Her face was against his breast.
jen_amused_130|She was his now  forever.
jen_amused_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
jen_amused_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
jen_amused_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
jen_amused_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
jen_amused_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
jen_amused_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
jen_amused_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
jen_amused_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
jen_amused_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
jen_amused_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
jen_amused_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
jen_amused_226|That came before my A B C's.
jen_amused_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
jen_amused_228|But it contributed to the smash.
jen_amused_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
jen_amused_230|Do you know any good land around here.
jen_amused_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
jen_amused_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
jen_amused_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
jen_amused_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
jen_amused_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
jen_amused_236|Don't you see I hate you.
jen_amused_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
jen_amused_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
jen_amused_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
jen_amused_240|Wash your hands of me.
jen_amused_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
jen_amused_242|I saw it when she rolled.
jen_amused_243|I only read the quotations.
jen_amused_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
jen_amused_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
jen_amused_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
jen_amused_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
jen_amused_248|I had been sad too long already.
jen_amused_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
jen_amused_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
jen_amused_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
jen_amused_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
jen_amused_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
jen_amused_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
jen_amused_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
jen_amused_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
jen_amused_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
jen_amused_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
jen_amused_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
jen_amused_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
jen_amused_317|He was a wise hyena.
jen_amused_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
jen_amused_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
jen_amused_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
jen_amused_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
jen_amused_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
jen_amused_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
jen_amused_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
jen_amused_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
jen_amused_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
jen_amused_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
jen_amused_329|Ah  indeed.
jen_amused_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
jen_amused_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
jen_amused_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
jen_amused_333|This is no place for you.
jen_amused_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
jen_amused_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
jen_amused_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
jen_amused_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
jen_amused_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
jen_amused_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
jen_amused_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
jen_amused_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
jen_amused_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
jen_amused_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
jen_amused_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
jen_amused_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
jen_amused_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
jen_amused_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
jen_amused_460|I had forgotten their existence.
jen_amused_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
jen_amused_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
jen_amused_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
jen_amused_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
jen_amused_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
jen_amused_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
jen_amused_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
jen_amused_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
jen_amused_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
jen_amused_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
jen_amused_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
jen_amused_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
jen_amused_473|The night was calm and snowy.
jen_amused_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
jen_amused_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
jen_amused_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
jen_anger_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
jen_anger_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
jen_anger_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
jen_anger_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
jen_anger_005|Will we ever forget it.
jen_anger_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
jen_anger_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
jen_anger_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
jen_anger_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
jen_anger_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
jen_anger_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
jen_anger_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
jen_anger_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
jen_anger_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
jen_anger_015|It's the aurora borealis.
jen_anger_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
jen_anger_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
jen_anger_018|There was a change now.
jen_anger_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
jen_anger_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
jen_anger_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
jen_anger_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
jen_anger_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
jen_anger_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
jen_anger_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
jen_anger_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
jen_anger_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
jen_anger_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
jen_anger_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
jen_anger_030|I had faith in them.
jen_anger_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
jen_anger_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
jen_anger_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
jen_anger_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
jen_anger_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
jen_anger_036|She turned in at the hotel.
jen_anger_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
jen_anger_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
jen_anger_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
jen_anger_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
jen_anger_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
jen_anger_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
jen_anger_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
jen_anger_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
jen_anger_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
jen_anger_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
jen_anger_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
jen_anger_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
jen_anger_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
jen_anger_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
jen_anger_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
jen_anger_052|It was a curious coincidence.
jen_anger_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
jen_anger_054|There was nothing on the rock.
jen_anger_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
jen_anger_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
jen_anger_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
jen_anger_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
jen_anger_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
jen_anger_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
jen_anger_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
jen_anger_062|The men stared into each other's face.
jen_anger_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
jen_anger_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
jen_anger_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
jen_anger_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
jen_anger_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
jen_anger_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
jen_anger_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
jen_anger_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
jen_anger_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
jen_anger_072|But who was Eileen's double.
jen_anger_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
jen_anger_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
jen_anger_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
jen_anger_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
jen_anger_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
jen_anger_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
jen_anger_079|It was a large canoe.
jen_anger_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
jen_anger_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
jen_anger_082|His face was streaming with blood.
jen_anger_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
jen_anger_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
jen_anger_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
jen_anger_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
jen_anger_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
jen_anger_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
jen_anger_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
jen_anger_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
jen_anger_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
jen_anger_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
jen_anger_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
jen_anger_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
jen_anger_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
jen_anger_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
jen_anger_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
jen_anger_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
jen_anger_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
jen_anger_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
jen_anger_129|Her face was against his breast.
jen_anger_130|She was his now  forever.
jen_anger_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
jen_anger_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
jen_anger_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
jen_anger_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
jen_anger_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
jen_anger_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
jen_anger_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
jen_anger_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
jen_anger_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
jen_anger_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
jen_anger_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
jen_anger_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
jen_anger_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
jen_anger_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
jen_anger_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
jen_anger_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
jen_anger_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
jen_anger_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
jen_anger_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
jen_anger_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
jen_anger_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
jen_anger_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
jen_anger_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
jen_anger_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
jen_anger_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
jen_anger_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
jen_anger_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
jen_anger_158|Does that look good.
jen_anger_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
jen_anger_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
jen_anger_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
jen_anger_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
jen_anger_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
jen_anger_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
jen_anger_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
jen_anger_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
jen_anger_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
jen_anger_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
jen_anger_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
jen_anger_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
jen_anger_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
jen_anger_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
jen_anger_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
jen_anger_174|They were the presage of storm.
jen_anger_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
jen_anger_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
jen_anger_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
jen_anger_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
jen_anger_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
jen_anger_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
jen_anger_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
jen_anger_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
jen_anger_183|And the air was growing chilly.
jen_anger_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
jen_anger_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
jen_anger_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
jen_anger_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
jen_anger_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
jen_anger_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
jen_anger_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
jen_anger_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
jen_anger_192|He did not rush in.
jen_anger_193|It was edged with ice.
jen_anger_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
jen_anger_195|But a strange thing happened.
jen_anger_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
jen_anger_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
jen_anger_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
jen_anger_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
jen_anger_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
jen_anger_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
jen_anger_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
jen_anger_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
jen_anger_205|From now on we're pals.
jen_anger_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
jen_anger_207|How much was it.
jen_anger_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
jen_anger_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
jen_anger_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
jen_anger_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
jen_anger_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
jen_anger_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
jen_anger_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
jen_anger_215|They die out of spite.
jen_anger_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
jen_anger_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
jen_anger_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
jen_anger_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
jen_anger_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
jen_anger_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
jen_anger_222|What part of the United States is your home.
jen_anger_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
jen_anger_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
jen_anger_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
jen_anger_226|That came before my A B C's.
jen_anger_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
jen_anger_228|But it contributed to the smash.
jen_anger_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
jen_anger_230|Do you know any good land around here.
jen_anger_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
jen_anger_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
jen_anger_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
jen_anger_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
jen_anger_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
jen_anger_236|Don't you see I hate you.
jen_anger_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
jen_anger_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
jen_anger_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
jen_anger_240|Wash your hands of me.
jen_anger_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
jen_anger_242|I saw it when she rolled.
jen_anger_243|I only read the quotations.
jen_anger_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
jen_anger_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
jen_anger_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
jen_anger_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
jen_anger_248|I had been sad too long already.
jen_anger_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
jen_anger_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
jen_anger_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
jen_anger_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
jen_anger_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
jen_anger_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
jen_anger_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
jen_anger_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
jen_anger_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
jen_anger_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
jen_anger_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
jen_anger_261|I have been doubly baptized.
jen_anger_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
jen_anger_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
jen_anger_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
jen_anger_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
jen_anger_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
jen_anger_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
jen_anger_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
jen_anger_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
jen_anger_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
jen_anger_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
jen_anger_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
jen_anger_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
jen_anger_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
jen_anger_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
jen_anger_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
jen_anger_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
jen_anger_279|She said with chattering teeth.
jen_anger_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
jen_anger_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
jen_anger_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
jen_anger_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
jen_anger_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
jen_anger_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
jen_anger_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
jen_anger_287|Keep an eye on him.
jen_anger_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
jen_anger_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
jen_anger_290|One by one the boys were captured.
jen_anger_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
jen_anger_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
jen_anger_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
jen_anger_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
jen_anger_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
jen_anger_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
jen_anger_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
jen_anger_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
jen_anger_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
jen_anger_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
jen_anger_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
jen_anger_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
jen_anger_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
jen_anger_304|I graduated last of my class.
jen_anger_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
jen_anger_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
jen_anger_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
jen_anger_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
jen_anger_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
jen_anger_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
jen_anger_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
jen_anger_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
jen_anger_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
jen_anger_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
jen_anger_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
jen_anger_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
jen_anger_317|He was a wise hyena.
jen_anger_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
jen_anger_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
jen_anger_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
jen_anger_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
jen_anger_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
jen_anger_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
jen_anger_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
jen_anger_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
jen_anger_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
jen_anger_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
jen_anger_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
jen_anger_329|Ah  indeed.
jen_anger_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
jen_anger_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
jen_anger_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
jen_anger_333|This is no place for you.
jen_anger_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
jen_anger_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
jen_anger_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
jen_anger_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
jen_anger_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
jen_anger_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
jen_anger_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
jen_anger_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
jen_anger_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
jen_anger_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
jen_anger_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
jen_anger_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
jen_anger_346|Get down and dig in.
jen_anger_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
jen_anger_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
jen_anger_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
jen_anger_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
jen_anger_351|It was more like sugar.
jen_anger_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
jen_anger_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
jen_anger_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
jen_anger_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
jen_anger_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
jen_anger_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
jen_anger_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
jen_anger_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
jen_anger_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
jen_anger_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
jen_anger_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
jen_anger_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
jen_anger_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
jen_anger_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
jen_anger_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
jen_anger_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
jen_anger_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
jen_anger_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
jen_anger_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
jen_anger_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
jen_anger_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
jen_anger_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
jen_anger_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
jen_anger_379|How old are you  daddy.
jen_anger_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
jen_anger_381|My name's Ferguson.
jen_anger_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
jen_anger_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
jen_anger_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
jen_anger_385|That's what Carnegie did.
jen_anger_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
jen_anger_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
jen_anger_388|It was my idea to a tee.
jen_anger_389|Mab  she said.
jen_anger_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
jen_anger_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
jen_anger_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
jen_anger_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
jen_anger_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
jen_anger_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
jen_anger_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
jen_anger_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
jen_anger_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
jen_anger_399|And here's another idea.
jen_anger_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
jen_anger_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
jen_anger_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
jen_anger_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
jen_anger_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
jen_anger_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
jen_anger_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
jen_anger_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
jen_anger_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
jen_anger_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
jen_anger_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
jen_anger_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
jen_anger_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
jen_anger_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
jen_anger_414|Now our figuring was all right.
jen_anger_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
jen_anger_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
jen_anger_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
jen_anger_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
jen_anger_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
jen_anger_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
jen_anger_421|By golly  the boy wins.
jen_anger_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
jen_anger_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
jen_anger_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
jen_anger_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
jen_anger_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
jen_anger_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
jen_anger_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
jen_anger_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
jen_anger_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
jen_anger_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
jen_anger_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
jen_anger_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
jen_anger_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
jen_anger_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
jen_anger_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
jen_anger_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
jen_anger_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
jen_anger_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
jen_anger_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
jen_anger_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
jen_anger_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
jen_anger_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
jen_anger_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
jen_anger_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
jen_anger_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
jen_anger_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
jen_anger_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
jen_anger_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
jen_anger_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
jen_anger_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
jen_anger_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
jen_anger_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
jen_anger_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
jen_anger_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
jen_anger_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
jen_anger_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
jen_anger_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
jen_anger_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
jen_anger_460|I had forgotten their existence.
jen_anger_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
jen_anger_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
jen_anger_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
jen_anger_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
jen_anger_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
jen_anger_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
jen_anger_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
jen_anger_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
jen_anger_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
jen_anger_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
jen_anger_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
jen_anger_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
jen_anger_473|The night was calm and snowy.
jen_anger_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
jen_anger_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
jen_anger_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
jen_anger_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
jen_anger_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
jen_anger_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
jen_anger_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
jen_anger_481|Nimrod replied  with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
jen_anger_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
jen_anger_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
jen_anger_484|No-sir-ee.
jen_anger_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
jen_anger_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
jen_anger_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
jen_anger_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
jen_anger_489|They were artists  not biologists.
jen_anger_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
jen_anger_491|And as in denial of guilt  the one-legged boy replied.
jen_anger_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
jen_anger_493|The boy  O'Brien  was specially maltreated.
jen_anger_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
jen_anger_495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
jen_anger_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
jen_anger_497|King took every advantage he knew.
jen_anger_498|The lines were now very taut.
jen_anger_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
jen_anger_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
jen_anger_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
jen_anger_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
jen_anger_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
jen_anger_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
jen_anger_505|We fished sharks on Niihau together.
jen_anger_506|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
jen_anger_507|In short  my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
jen_anger_508|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
jen_anger_509|Yet  in accordance with Ernest's test of truth  it worked.
jen_anger_510|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
jen_anger_511|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
jen_anger_512|No  it is a palace  wherein there are many servants.
jen_anger_513|We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
jen_anger_514|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
jen_anger_515|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
jen_anger_516|Also  there was awe in their faces.
jen_anger_517|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
jen_anger_518|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
jen_anger_519|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
jen_anger_520|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
jen_anger_521|Without them he could not run his empire.
jen_anger_522|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
jen_anger_523|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
jen_anger_524|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
jen_anger_526|Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
jen_anger_527|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
jen_anger_528|Men who endure it  call it living death.
jen_anger_529|As I say  he had tapped the message very rapidly.
jen_anger_530|Ask him  I laughed  then turned to Pasquini.
jen_anger_531|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
jen_anger_532|May drought destroy your crops.
jenie_disgust_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
jenie_disgust_030|I had faith in them.
jenie_disgust_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
jenie_disgust_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
jenie_disgust_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
jenie_disgust_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
jenie_disgust_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
jenie_disgust_036|She turned in at the hotel.
jenie_disgust_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
jenie_disgust_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
jenie_disgust_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
jenie_disgust_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
jenie_disgust_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
jenie_disgust_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
jenie_disgust_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
jenie_disgust_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
jenie_disgust_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
jenie_disgust_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
jenie_disgust_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
jenie_disgust_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
jenie_disgust_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
jenie_disgust_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
jenie_disgust_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
jenie_disgust_052|It was a curious coincidence.
jenie_disgust_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
jenie_disgust_054|There was nothing on the rock.
jenie_disgust_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
jenie_disgust_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
jenie_disgust_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
jenie_disgust_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
jenie_disgust_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
jenie_disgust_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
jenie_disgust_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
jenie_disgust_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
jenie_disgust_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
jenie_disgust_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
jenie_disgust_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
jenie_disgust_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
jenie_disgust_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
jenie_disgust_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
jenie_disgust_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
jenie_disgust_098|Shall I carry you.
jenie_disgust_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
jenie_disgust_100|You must sleep  he urged.
jenie_disgust_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
jenie_disgust_102|He will follow us soon.
jenie_disgust_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
jenie_disgust_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
jenie_disgust_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
jenie_disgust_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
jenie_disgust_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
jenie_disgust_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
jenie_disgust_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
jenie_disgust_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
jenie_disgust_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
jenie_disgust_112|He was wounded in the arm.
jenie_disgust_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
jenie_disgust_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
jenie_disgust_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
jenie_disgust_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
jenie_disgust_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
jenie_disgust_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
jenie_disgust_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
jenie_disgust_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
jenie_disgust_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
jenie_disgust_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
jenie_disgust_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
jenie_disgust_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
jenie_disgust_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
jenie_disgust_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
jenie_disgust_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
jenie_disgust_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
jenie_disgust_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
jenie_disgust_158|Does that look good.
jenie_disgust_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
jenie_disgust_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
jenie_disgust_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
jenie_disgust_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
jenie_disgust_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
jenie_disgust_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
jenie_disgust_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
jenie_disgust_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
jenie_disgust_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
jenie_disgust_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
jenie_disgust_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
jenie_disgust_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
jenie_disgust_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
jenie_disgust_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
jenie_disgust_174|They were the presage of storm.
jenie_disgust_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
jenie_disgust_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
jenie_disgust_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
jenie_disgust_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
jenie_disgust_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
jenie_disgust_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
jenie_disgust_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
jenie_disgust_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
jenie_disgust_183|And the air was growing chilly.
jenie_disgust_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
jenie_disgust_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
jenie_disgust_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
jenie_disgust_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
jenie_disgust_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
jenie_disgust_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
jenie_disgust_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
jenie_disgust_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
jenie_disgust_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
jenie_disgust_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
jenie_disgust_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
jenie_disgust_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
jenie_disgust_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
jenie_disgust_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
jenie_disgust_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
jenie_disgust_261|I have been doubly baptized.
jenie_disgust_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
jenie_disgust_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
jenie_disgust_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
jenie_disgust_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
jenie_disgust_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
jenie_disgust_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
jenie_disgust_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
jenie_disgust_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
jenie_disgust_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
jenie_disgust_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
jenie_disgust_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
jenie_disgust_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
jenie_disgust_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
jenie_disgust_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
jenie_disgust_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
jenie_disgust_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
jenie_disgust_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
jenie_disgust_279|She said with chattering teeth.
jenie_disgust_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
jenie_disgust_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
jenie_disgust_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
jenie_disgust_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
jenie_disgust_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
jenie_disgust_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
jenie_disgust_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
jenie_disgust_399|And here's another idea.
jenie_disgust_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
jenie_disgust_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
jenie_disgust_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
jenie_disgust_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
jenie_disgust_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
jenie_disgust_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
jenie_disgust_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
jenie_disgust_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
jenie_disgust_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
jenie_disgust_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
jenie_disgust_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
jenie_disgust_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
jenie_disgust_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
jenie_disgust_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
jenie_disgust_414|Now our figuring was all right.
jenie_disgust_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
jenie_disgust_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
jenie_disgust_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
jenie_disgust_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
jenie_disgust_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
jenie_disgust_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
jenie_disgust_533|Dunham  can your boy go along with Jesse.
jenie_disgust_534|But Johannes could  and did.
jenie_disgust_535|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
jenie_disgust_536|He would destroy all things that are fixed.
jenie_disgust_537|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
jenie_disgust_538|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer  I have lived.
jenie_disgust_539|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
jenie_disgust_540|Yea  so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
jenie_disgust_541|The Warden with a quart of champagne.
jenie_disgust_542|Without a doubt  some of them have dinner engagements.
jenie_disgust_543|I had been born with no organic  chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
jenie_disgust_544|He may anticipate the day of his death.
jenie_disgust_545|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
jenie_disgust_546|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
jenie_disgust_547|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
jenie_disgust_548|Also  churches and preachers I had never known.
jenie_disgust_549|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
jenie_disgust_550|This also became part of the daily schedule.
jenie_disgust_551|All an appearance can know is mirage.
jenie_disgust_552|Yet he dreams he is immortal  I argue feebly.
jenie_disgust_553|I am writing these lines in Honolulu  Hawaii.
jenie_disgust_554|Jack London  Waikiki Beach  Honolulu  Oahu.
jenie_disgust_555|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
jenie_disgust_556|Why  he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
jenie_disgust_557|The last refugee had passed.
jenie_disgust_558|And the foundation stone of service  in his case  was obedience.
jenie_disgust_559|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
jenie_disgust_560|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
jenie_neutral_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
jenie_neutral_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
jenie_neutral_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
jenie_neutral_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
jenie_neutral_005|Will we ever forget it.
jenie_neutral_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
jenie_neutral_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
jenie_neutral_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
jenie_neutral_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
jenie_neutral_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
jenie_neutral_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
jenie_neutral_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
jenie_neutral_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
jenie_neutral_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
jenie_neutral_015|It's the aurora borealis.
jenie_neutral_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
jenie_neutral_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
jenie_neutral_018|There was a change now.
jenie_neutral_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
jenie_neutral_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
jenie_neutral_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
jenie_neutral_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
jenie_neutral_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
jenie_neutral_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
jenie_neutral_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
jenie_neutral_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
jenie_neutral_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
jenie_neutral_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
jenie_neutral_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
jenie_neutral_030|I had faith in them.
jenie_neutral_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
jenie_neutral_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
jenie_neutral_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
jenie_neutral_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
jenie_neutral_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
jenie_neutral_036|She turned in at the hotel.
jenie_neutral_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
jenie_neutral_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
jenie_neutral_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
jenie_neutral_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
jenie_neutral_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
jenie_neutral_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
jenie_neutral_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
jenie_neutral_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
jenie_neutral_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
jenie_neutral_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
jenie_neutral_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
jenie_neutral_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
jenie_neutral_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
jenie_neutral_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
jenie_neutral_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
jenie_neutral_052|It was a curious coincidence.
jenie_neutral_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
jenie_neutral_054|There was nothing on the rock.
jenie_neutral_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
jenie_neutral_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
jenie_neutral_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
jenie_neutral_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
jenie_neutral_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
jenie_neutral_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
jenie_neutral_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
jenie_neutral_062|The men stared into each other's face.
jenie_neutral_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
jenie_neutral_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
jenie_neutral_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
jenie_neutral_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
jenie_neutral_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
jenie_neutral_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
jenie_neutral_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
jenie_neutral_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
jenie_neutral_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
jenie_neutral_072|But who was Eileen's double.
jenie_neutral_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
jenie_neutral_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
jenie_neutral_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
jenie_neutral_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
jenie_neutral_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
jenie_neutral_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
jenie_neutral_079|It was a large canoe.
jenie_neutral_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
jenie_neutral_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
jenie_neutral_082|His face was streaming with blood.
jenie_neutral_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
jenie_neutral_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
jenie_neutral_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
jenie_neutral_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
jenie_neutral_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
jenie_neutral_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
jenie_neutral_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
jenie_neutral_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
jenie_neutral_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
jenie_neutral_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
jenie_neutral_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
jenie_neutral_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
jenie_neutral_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
jenie_neutral_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
jenie_neutral_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
jenie_neutral_098|Shall I carry you.
jenie_neutral_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
jenie_neutral_100|You must sleep  he urged.
jenie_neutral_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
jenie_neutral_102|He will follow us soon.
jenie_neutral_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
jenie_neutral_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
jenie_neutral_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
jenie_neutral_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
jenie_neutral_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
jenie_neutral_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
jenie_neutral_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
jenie_neutral_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
jenie_neutral_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
jenie_neutral_112|He was wounded in the arm.
jenie_neutral_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
jenie_neutral_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
jenie_neutral_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
jenie_neutral_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
jenie_neutral_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
jenie_neutral_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
jenie_neutral_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
jenie_neutral_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
jenie_neutral_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
jenie_neutral_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
jenie_neutral_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
jenie_neutral_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
jenie_neutral_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
jenie_neutral_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
jenie_neutral_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
jenie_neutral_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
jenie_neutral_129|Her face was against his breast.
jenie_neutral_130|She was his now  forever.
jenie_neutral_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
jenie_neutral_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
jenie_neutral_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
jenie_neutral_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
jenie_neutral_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
jenie_neutral_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
jenie_neutral_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
jenie_neutral_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
jenie_neutral_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
jenie_neutral_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
jenie_neutral_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
jenie_neutral_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
jenie_neutral_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
jenie_neutral_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
jenie_neutral_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
jenie_neutral_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
jenie_neutral_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
jenie_neutral_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
jenie_neutral_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
jenie_neutral_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
jenie_neutral_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
jenie_neutral_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
jenie_neutral_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
jenie_neutral_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
jenie_neutral_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
jenie_neutral_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
jenie_neutral_158|Does that look good.
jenie_neutral_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
jenie_neutral_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
jenie_neutral_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
jenie_neutral_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
jenie_neutral_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
jenie_neutral_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
jenie_neutral_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
jenie_neutral_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
jenie_neutral_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
jenie_neutral_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
jenie_neutral_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
jenie_neutral_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
jenie_neutral_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
jenie_neutral_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
jenie_neutral_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
jenie_neutral_174|They were the presage of storm.
jenie_neutral_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
jenie_neutral_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
jenie_neutral_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
jenie_neutral_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
jenie_neutral_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
jenie_neutral_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
jenie_neutral_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
jenie_neutral_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
jenie_neutral_183|And the air was growing chilly.
jenie_neutral_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
jenie_neutral_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
jenie_neutral_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
jenie_neutral_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
jenie_neutral_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
jenie_neutral_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
jenie_neutral_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
jenie_neutral_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
jenie_neutral_192|He did not rush in.
jenie_neutral_193|It was edged with ice.
jenie_neutral_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
jenie_neutral_195|But a strange thing happened.
jenie_neutral_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
jenie_neutral_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
jenie_neutral_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
jenie_neutral_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
jenie_neutral_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
jenie_neutral_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
jenie_neutral_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
jenie_neutral_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
jenie_neutral_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
jenie_neutral_205|From now on we're pals.
jenie_neutral_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
jenie_neutral_207|How much was it.
jenie_neutral_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
jenie_neutral_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
jenie_neutral_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
jenie_neutral_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
jenie_neutral_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
jenie_neutral_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
jenie_neutral_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
jenie_neutral_215|They die out of spite.
jenie_neutral_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
jenie_neutral_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
jenie_neutral_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
jenie_neutral_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
jenie_neutral_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
jenie_neutral_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
jenie_neutral_222|What part of the United States is your home.
jenie_neutral_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
jenie_neutral_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
jenie_neutral_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
jenie_neutral_226|That came before my A B C's.
jenie_neutral_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
jenie_neutral_228|But it contributed to the smash.
jenie_neutral_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
jenie_neutral_230|Do you know any good land around here.
jenie_neutral_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
jenie_neutral_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
jenie_neutral_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
jenie_neutral_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
jenie_neutral_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
jenie_neutral_236|Don't you see I hate you.
jenie_neutral_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
jenie_neutral_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
jenie_neutral_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
jenie_neutral_240|Wash your hands of me.
jenie_neutral_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
jenie_neutral_242|I saw it when she rolled.
jenie_neutral_243|I only read the quotations.
jenie_neutral_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
jenie_neutral_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
jenie_neutral_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
jenie_neutral_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
jenie_neutral_248|I had been sad too long already.
jenie_neutral_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
jenie_neutral_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
jenie_neutral_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
jenie_neutral_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
jenie_neutral_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
jenie_neutral_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
jenie_neutral_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
jenie_neutral_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
jenie_neutral_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
jenie_neutral_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
jenie_neutral_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
jenie_neutral_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
jenie_neutral_261|I have been doubly baptized.
jenie_neutral_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
jenie_neutral_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
jenie_neutral_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
jenie_neutral_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
jenie_neutral_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
jenie_neutral_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
jenie_neutral_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
jenie_neutral_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
jenie_neutral_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
jenie_neutral_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
jenie_neutral_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
jenie_neutral_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
jenie_neutral_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
jenie_neutral_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
jenie_neutral_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
jenie_neutral_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
jenie_neutral_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
jenie_neutral_279|She said with chattering teeth.
jenie_neutral_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
jenie_neutral_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
jenie_neutral_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
jenie_neutral_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
jenie_neutral_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
jenie_neutral_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
jenie_neutral_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
jenie_neutral_287|Keep an eye on him.
jenie_neutral_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
jenie_neutral_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
jenie_neutral_290|One by one the boys were captured.
jenie_neutral_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
jenie_neutral_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
jenie_neutral_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
jenie_neutral_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
jenie_neutral_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
jenie_neutral_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
jenie_neutral_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
jenie_neutral_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
jenie_neutral_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
jenie_neutral_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
jenie_neutral_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
jenie_neutral_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
jenie_neutral_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
jenie_neutral_304|I graduated last of my class.
jenie_neutral_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
jenie_neutral_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
jenie_neutral_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
jenie_neutral_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
jenie_neutral_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
jenie_neutral_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
jenie_neutral_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
jenie_neutral_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
jenie_neutral_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
jenie_neutral_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
jenie_neutral_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
jenie_neutral_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
jenie_neutral_317|He was a wise hyena.
jenie_neutral_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
jenie_neutral_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
jenie_neutral_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
jenie_neutral_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
jenie_neutral_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
jenie_neutral_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
jenie_neutral_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
jenie_neutral_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
jenie_neutral_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
jenie_neutral_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
jenie_neutral_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
jenie_neutral_329|Ah  indeed.
jenie_neutral_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
jenie_neutral_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
jenie_neutral_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
jenie_neutral_333|This is no place for you.
jenie_neutral_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
jenie_neutral_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
jenie_neutral_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
jenie_neutral_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
jenie_neutral_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
jenie_neutral_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
jenie_neutral_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
jenie_neutral_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
jenie_neutral_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
jenie_neutral_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
jenie_neutral_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
jenie_neutral_346|Get down and dig in.
jenie_neutral_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
jenie_neutral_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
jenie_neutral_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
jenie_neutral_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
jenie_neutral_351|It was more like sugar.
jenie_neutral_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
jenie_neutral_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
jenie_neutral_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
jenie_neutral_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
jenie_neutral_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
jenie_neutral_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
jenie_neutral_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
jenie_neutral_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
jenie_neutral_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
jenie_neutral_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
jenie_neutral_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
jenie_neutral_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
jenie_neutral_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
jenie_neutral_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
jenie_neutral_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
jenie_neutral_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
jenie_neutral_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
jenie_neutral_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
jenie_neutral_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
jenie_neutral_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
jenie_neutral_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
jenie_neutral_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
jenie_neutral_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
jenie_neutral_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
jenie_neutral_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
jenie_neutral_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
jenie_neutral_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
jenie_neutral_379|How old are you  daddy.
jenie_neutral_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
jenie_neutral_381|My name's Ferguson.
jenie_neutral_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
jenie_neutral_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
jenie_neutral_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
jenie_neutral_385|That's what Carnegie did.
jenie_neutral_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
jenie_neutral_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
jenie_neutral_388|It was my idea to a tee.
jenie_neutral_389|Mab  she said.
jenie_neutral_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
jenie_neutral_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
jenie_neutral_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
jenie_neutral_421|By golly  the boy wins.
jenie_neutral_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
jenie_neutral_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
jenie_neutral_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
jenie_neutral_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
jenie_neutral_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
jenie_neutral_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
jenie_neutral_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
jenie_neutral_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
jenie_neutral_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
jenie_neutral_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
jenie_neutral_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
jenie_neutral_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
jenie_neutral_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
jenie_neutral_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
jenie_neutral_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
jenie_neutral_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
jenie_neutral_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
jenie_neutral_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
jenie_neutral_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
jenie_neutral_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
jenie_neutral_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
jenie_neutral_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
jenie_neutral_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
jenie_neutral_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
jenie_neutral_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
jenie_neutral_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
jenie_sleepiness_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
jenie_sleepiness_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
jenie_sleepiness_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
jenie_sleepiness_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
jenie_sleepiness_005|Will we ever forget it.
jenie_sleepiness_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
jenie_sleepiness_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
jenie_sleepiness_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
jenie_sleepiness_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
jenie_sleepiness_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
jenie_sleepiness_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
jenie_sleepiness_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
jenie_sleepiness_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
jenie_sleepiness_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
jenie_sleepiness_015|It's the aurora borealis.
jenie_sleepiness_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
jenie_sleepiness_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
jenie_sleepiness_018|There was a change now.
jenie_sleepiness_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
jenie_sleepiness_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
jenie_sleepiness_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
jenie_sleepiness_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
jenie_sleepiness_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
jenie_sleepiness_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
jenie_sleepiness_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
jenie_sleepiness_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
jenie_sleepiness_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
jenie_sleepiness_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
jenie_sleepiness_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
jenie_sleepiness_030|I had faith in them.
jenie_sleepiness_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
jenie_sleepiness_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
jenie_sleepiness_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
jenie_sleepiness_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
jenie_sleepiness_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
jenie_sleepiness_036|She turned in at the hotel.
jenie_sleepiness_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
jenie_sleepiness_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
jenie_sleepiness_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
jenie_sleepiness_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
jenie_sleepiness_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
jenie_sleepiness_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
jenie_sleepiness_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
jenie_sleepiness_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
jenie_sleepiness_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
jenie_sleepiness_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
jenie_sleepiness_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
jenie_sleepiness_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
jenie_sleepiness_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
jenie_sleepiness_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
jenie_sleepiness_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
jenie_sleepiness_052|It was a curious coincidence.
jenie_sleepiness_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
jenie_sleepiness_054|There was nothing on the rock.
jenie_sleepiness_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
jenie_sleepiness_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
jenie_sleepiness_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
jenie_sleepiness_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
jenie_sleepiness_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
jenie_sleepiness_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
jenie_sleepiness_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
jenie_sleepiness_062|The men stared into each other's face.
jenie_sleepiness_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
jenie_sleepiness_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
jenie_sleepiness_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
jenie_sleepiness_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
jenie_sleepiness_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
jenie_sleepiness_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
jenie_sleepiness_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
jenie_sleepiness_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
jenie_sleepiness_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
jenie_sleepiness_072|But who was Eileen's double.
jenie_sleepiness_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
jenie_sleepiness_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
jenie_sleepiness_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
jenie_sleepiness_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
jenie_sleepiness_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
jenie_sleepiness_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
jenie_sleepiness_079|It was a large canoe.
jenie_sleepiness_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
jenie_sleepiness_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
jenie_sleepiness_082|His face was streaming with blood.
jenie_sleepiness_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
jenie_sleepiness_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
jenie_sleepiness_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
jenie_sleepiness_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
jenie_sleepiness_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
jenie_sleepiness_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
jenie_sleepiness_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
jenie_sleepiness_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
jenie_sleepiness_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
jenie_sleepiness_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
jenie_sleepiness_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
jenie_sleepiness_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
jenie_sleepiness_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
jenie_sleepiness_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
jenie_sleepiness_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
jenie_sleepiness_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
jenie_sleepiness_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
jenie_sleepiness_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
jenie_sleepiness_129|Her face was against his breast.
jenie_sleepiness_130|She was his now  forever.
jenie_sleepiness_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
jenie_sleepiness_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
jenie_sleepiness_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
jenie_sleepiness_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
jenie_sleepiness_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
jenie_sleepiness_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
jenie_sleepiness_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
jenie_sleepiness_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
jenie_sleepiness_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
jenie_sleepiness_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
jenie_sleepiness_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
jenie_sleepiness_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
jenie_sleepiness_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
jenie_sleepiness_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
jenie_sleepiness_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
jenie_sleepiness_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
jenie_sleepiness_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
jenie_sleepiness_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
jenie_sleepiness_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
jenie_sleepiness_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
jenie_sleepiness_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
jenie_sleepiness_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
jenie_sleepiness_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
jenie_sleepiness_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
jenie_sleepiness_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
jenie_sleepiness_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
jenie_sleepiness_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
jenie_sleepiness_158|Does that look good.
jenie_sleepiness_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
jenie_sleepiness_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
jenie_sleepiness_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
jenie_sleepiness_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
jenie_sleepiness_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
jenie_sleepiness_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
jenie_sleepiness_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
jenie_sleepiness_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
jenie_sleepiness_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
jenie_sleepiness_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
jenie_sleepiness_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
jenie_sleepiness_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
jenie_sleepiness_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
jenie_sleepiness_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
jenie_sleepiness_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
jenie_sleepiness_174|They were the presage of storm.
jenie_sleepiness_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
jenie_sleepiness_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
jenie_sleepiness_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
jenie_sleepiness_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
jenie_sleepiness_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
jenie_sleepiness_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
jenie_sleepiness_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
jenie_sleepiness_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
jenie_sleepiness_183|And the air was growing chilly.
jenie_sleepiness_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
jenie_sleepiness_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
jenie_sleepiness_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
jenie_sleepiness_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
jenie_sleepiness_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
jenie_sleepiness_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
jenie_sleepiness_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
jenie_sleepiness_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
jenie_sleepiness_192|He did not rush in.
jenie_sleepiness_193|It was edged with ice.
jenie_sleepiness_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
jenie_sleepiness_195|But a strange thing happened.
jenie_sleepiness_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
jenie_sleepiness_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
jenie_sleepiness_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
jenie_sleepiness_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
jenie_sleepiness_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
jenie_sleepiness_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
jenie_sleepiness_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
jenie_sleepiness_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
jenie_sleepiness_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
jenie_sleepiness_205|From now on we're pals.
jenie_sleepiness_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
jenie_sleepiness_207|How much was it.
jenie_sleepiness_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
jenie_sleepiness_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
jenie_sleepiness_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
jenie_sleepiness_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
jenie_sleepiness_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
jenie_sleepiness_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
jenie_sleepiness_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
jenie_sleepiness_215|They die out of spite.
jenie_sleepiness_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
jenie_sleepiness_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
jenie_sleepiness_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
jenie_sleepiness_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
jenie_sleepiness_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
jenie_sleepiness_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
jenie_sleepiness_222|What part of the United States is your home.
jenie_sleepiness_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
jenie_sleepiness_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
jenie_sleepiness_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
jenie_sleepiness_226|That came before my A B C's.
jenie_sleepiness_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
jenie_sleepiness_228|But it contributed to the smash.
jenie_sleepiness_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
jenie_sleepiness_230|Do you know any good land around here.
jenie_sleepiness_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
jenie_sleepiness_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
jenie_sleepiness_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
jenie_sleepiness_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
jenie_sleepiness_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
jenie_sleepiness_236|Don't you see I hate you.
jenie_sleepiness_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
jenie_sleepiness_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
jenie_sleepiness_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
jenie_sleepiness_240|Wash your hands of me.
jenie_sleepiness_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
jenie_sleepiness_242|I saw it when she rolled.
jenie_sleepiness_243|I only read the quotations.
jenie_sleepiness_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
jenie_sleepiness_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
jenie_sleepiness_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
jenie_sleepiness_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
jenie_sleepiness_248|I had been sad too long already.
jenie_sleepiness_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
jenie_sleepiness_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
jenie_sleepiness_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
jenie_sleepiness_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
jenie_sleepiness_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
jenie_sleepiness_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
jenie_sleepiness_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
jenie_sleepiness_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
jenie_sleepiness_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
jenie_sleepiness_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
jenie_sleepiness_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
jenie_sleepiness_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
jenie_sleepiness_261|I have been doubly baptized.
jenie_sleepiness_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
jenie_sleepiness_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
jenie_sleepiness_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
jenie_sleepiness_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
jenie_sleepiness_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
jenie_sleepiness_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
jenie_sleepiness_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
jenie_sleepiness_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
jenie_sleepiness_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
jenie_sleepiness_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
jenie_sleepiness_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
jenie_sleepiness_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
jenie_sleepiness_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
jenie_sleepiness_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
jenie_sleepiness_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
jenie_sleepiness_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
jenie_sleepiness_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
jenie_sleepiness_279|She said with chattering teeth.
jenie_sleepiness_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
jenie_sleepiness_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
jenie_sleepiness_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
jenie_sleepiness_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
jenie_sleepiness_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
jenie_sleepiness_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
jenie_sleepiness_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
jenie_sleepiness_287|Keep an eye on him.
jenie_sleepiness_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
jenie_sleepiness_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
jenie_sleepiness_290|One by one the boys were captured.
jenie_sleepiness_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
jenie_sleepiness_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
jenie_sleepiness_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
jenie_sleepiness_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
jenie_sleepiness_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
jenie_sleepiness_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
jenie_sleepiness_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
jenie_sleepiness_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
jenie_sleepiness_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
jenie_sleepiness_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
jenie_sleepiness_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
jenie_sleepiness_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
jenie_sleepiness_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
jenie_sleepiness_304|I graduated last of my class.
jenie_sleepiness_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
jenie_sleepiness_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
jenie_sleepiness_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
jenie_sleepiness_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
jenie_sleepiness_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
jenie_sleepiness_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
jenie_sleepiness_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
jenie_sleepiness_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
jenie_sleepiness_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
jenie_sleepiness_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
jenie_sleepiness_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
jenie_sleepiness_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
jenie_sleepiness_317|He was a wise hyena.
jenie_sleepiness_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
jenie_sleepiness_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
jenie_sleepiness_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
jenie_sleepiness_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
jenie_sleepiness_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
jenie_sleepiness_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
jenie_sleepiness_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
jenie_sleepiness_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
jenie_sleepiness_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
jenie_sleepiness_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
jenie_sleepiness_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
jenie_sleepiness_329|Ah  indeed.
jenie_sleepiness_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
jenie_sleepiness_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
jenie_sleepiness_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
jenie_sleepiness_333|This is no place for you.
jenie_sleepiness_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
jenie_sleepiness_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
jenie_sleepiness_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
jenie_sleepiness_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
jenie_sleepiness_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
jenie_sleepiness_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
jenie_sleepiness_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
jenie_sleepiness_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
jenie_sleepiness_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
jenie_sleepiness_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
jenie_sleepiness_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
jenie_sleepiness_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
jenie_sleepiness_346|Get down and dig in.
jenie_sleepiness_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
jenie_sleepiness_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
jenie_sleepiness_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
jenie_sleepiness_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
jenie_sleepiness_351|It was more like sugar.
jenie_sleepiness_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
jenie_sleepiness_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
jenie_sleepiness_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
jenie_sleepiness_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
jenie_sleepiness_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
jenie_sleepiness_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
jenie_sleepiness_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
jenie_sleepiness_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
jenie_sleepiness_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
jenie_sleepiness_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
jenie_sleepiness_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
jenie_sleepiness_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
jenie_sleepiness_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
jenie_sleepiness_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
jenie_sleepiness_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
jenie_sleepiness_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
jenie_sleepiness_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
jenie_sleepiness_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
jenie_sleepiness_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
jenie_sleepiness_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
jenie_sleepiness_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
jenie_sleepiness_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
jenie_sleepiness_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
jenie_sleepiness_379|How old are you  daddy.
jenie_sleepiness_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
jenie_sleepiness_381|My name's Ferguson.
jenie_sleepiness_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
jenie_sleepiness_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
jenie_sleepiness_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
jenie_sleepiness_385|That's what Carnegie did.
jenie_sleepiness_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
jenie_sleepiness_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
jenie_sleepiness_388|It was my idea to a tee.
jenie_sleepiness_389|Mab  she said.
jenie_sleepiness_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
jenie_sleepiness_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
jenie_sleepiness_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
jenie_sleepiness_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
jenie_sleepiness_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
jenie_sleepiness_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
jenie_sleepiness_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
jenie_sleepiness_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
jenie_sleepiness_399|And here's another idea.
jenie_sleepiness_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
jenie_sleepiness_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
jenie_sleepiness_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
jenie_sleepiness_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
jenie_sleepiness_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
jenie_sleepiness_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
jenie_sleepiness_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
jenie_sleepiness_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
jenie_sleepiness_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
jenie_sleepiness_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
jenie_sleepiness_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
jenie_sleepiness_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
jenie_sleepiness_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
jenie_sleepiness_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
jenie_sleepiness_414|Now our figuring was all right.
jenie_sleepiness_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
jenie_sleepiness_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
jenie_sleepiness_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
jenie_sleepiness_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
jenie_sleepiness_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
jenie_sleepiness_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
jenie_sleepiness_421|By golly  the boy wins.
jenie_sleepiness_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
jenie_sleepiness_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
jenie_sleepiness_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
jenie_sleepiness_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
jenie_sleepiness_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
jenie_sleepiness_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
jenie_sleepiness_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
jenie_sleepiness_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
jenie_sleepiness_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
jenie_sleepiness_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
jenie_sleepiness_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
jenie_sleepiness_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
jenie_sleepiness_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
jenie_sleepiness_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
jenie_sleepiness_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
jenie_sleepiness_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
jenie_sleepiness_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
jenie_sleepiness_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
jenie_sleepiness_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
jenie_sleepiness_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
jenie_sleepiness_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
jenie_sleepiness_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
jenie_sleepiness_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
jenie_sleepiness_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
jenie_sleepiness_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
jenie_sleepiness_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
jenie_sleepiness_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
jenie_sleepiness_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
jenie_sleepiness_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
jenie_sleepiness_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
jenie_sleepiness_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
jenie_sleepiness_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
jenie_sleepiness_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
jenie_sleepiness_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
jenie_sleepiness_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
jenie_sleepiness_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
jenie_sleepiness_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
jenie_sleepiness_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
jenie_sleepiness_460|I had forgotten their existence.
jenie_sleepiness_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
jenie_sleepiness_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
jenie_sleepiness_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
jenie_sleepiness_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
jenie_sleepiness_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
jenie_sleepiness_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
jenie_sleepiness_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
jenie_sleepiness_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
jenie_sleepiness_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
jenie_sleepiness_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
jenie_sleepiness_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
jenie_sleepiness_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
jenie_sleepiness_473|The night was calm and snowy.
jenie_sleepiness_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
jenie_sleepiness_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
jenie_sleepiness_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
jenie_sleepiness_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
jenie_sleepiness_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
jenie_sleepiness_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
jenie_sleepiness_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
jenie_sleepiness_481|Nimrod replied  with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
jenie_sleepiness_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
jenie_sleepiness_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
jenie_sleepiness_484|No-sir-ee.
jenie_sleepiness_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
jenie_sleepiness_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
jenie_sleepiness_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
jenie_sleepiness_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
jenie_sleepiness_489|They were artists  not biologists.
jenie_sleepiness_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
jenie_sleepiness_491|And as in denial of guilt  the one-legged boy replied.
jenie_sleepiness_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
jenie_sleepiness_493|The boy  O'Brien  was specially maltreated.
jenie_sleepiness_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
jenie_sleepiness_495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
jenie_sleepiness_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
jenie_sleepiness_497|King took every advantage he knew.
jenie_sleepiness_498|The lines were now very taut.
jenie_sleepiness_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
jenie_sleepiness_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
jenie_sleepiness_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
jenie_sleepiness_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
jenie_sleepiness_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
jenie_sleepiness_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
josh_amused_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels etc.
josh_amused_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
josh_amused_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
josh_amused_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
josh_amused_005|Will we ever forget it.
josh_amused_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
josh_amused_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
josh_amused_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
josh_amused_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
josh_amused_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
josh_amused_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
josh_amused_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
josh_amused_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
josh_amused_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
josh_amused_015|It's the aurora borealis.
josh_amused_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
josh_amused_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
josh_amused_018|There was a change now.
josh_amused_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
josh_amused_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
josh_amused_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
josh_amused_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
josh_amused_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
josh_amused_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
josh_amused_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
josh_amused_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
josh_amused_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
josh_amused_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
josh_amused_030|I had faith in them.
josh_amused_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
josh_amused_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
josh_amused_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
josh_amused_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
josh_amused_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
josh_amused_036|She turned in at the hotel.
josh_amused_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
josh_amused_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
josh_amused_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
josh_amused_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
josh_amused_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
josh_amused_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
josh_amused_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
josh_amused_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
josh_amused_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
josh_amused_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
josh_amused_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
josh_amused_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
josh_amused_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
josh_amused_052|It was a curious coincidence.
josh_amused_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
josh_amused_054|There was nothing on the rock.
josh_amused_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
josh_amused_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
josh_amused_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
josh_amused_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
josh_amused_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
josh_amused_062|The men stared into each other's face.
josh_amused_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
josh_amused_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
josh_amused_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
josh_amused_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
josh_amused_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
josh_amused_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
josh_amused_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
josh_amused_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
josh_amused_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
josh_amused_072|But who was Eileen's double.
josh_amused_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
josh_amused_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
josh_amused_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
josh_amused_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
josh_amused_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
josh_amused_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
josh_amused_079|It was a large canoe.
josh_amused_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
josh_amused_082|His face was streaming with blood.
josh_amused_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
josh_amused_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
josh_amused_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
josh_amused_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
josh_amused_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
josh_amused_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
josh_amused_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
josh_amused_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
josh_amused_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
josh_amused_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
josh_amused_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
josh_amused_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
josh_amused_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
josh_amused_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
josh_amused_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
josh_amused_098|Shall I carry you.
josh_amused_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
josh_amused_100|You must sleep  he urged.
josh_amused_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
josh_amused_102|He will follow us soon.
josh_amused_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
josh_amused_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
josh_amused_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
josh_amused_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
josh_amused_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
josh_amused_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
josh_amused_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
josh_amused_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
josh_amused_112|He was wounded in the arm.
josh_amused_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
josh_amused_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
josh_amused_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
josh_amused_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
josh_amused_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
josh_amused_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
josh_amused_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
josh_amused_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
josh_amused_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
josh_amused_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
josh_amused_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
josh_amused_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
josh_amused_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
josh_amused_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
josh_amused_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
josh_amused_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
josh_amused_129|Her face was against his breast.
josh_amused_130|She was his now  forever.
josh_amused_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
josh_amused_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
josh_amused_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
josh_amused_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
josh_amused_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
josh_amused_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
josh_amused_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
josh_amused_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
josh_amused_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
josh_amused_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
josh_amused_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
josh_amused_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
josh_amused_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
josh_amused_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
josh_amused_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
josh_amused_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
josh_amused_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
josh_amused_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
josh_amused_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
josh_amused_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
josh_amused_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
josh_amused_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
josh_amused_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
josh_amused_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
josh_amused_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
josh_amused_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
josh_amused_158|Does that look good.
josh_amused_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
josh_amused_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
josh_amused_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
josh_amused_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
josh_amused_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
josh_amused_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
josh_amused_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
josh_amused_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
josh_amused_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
josh_amused_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
josh_amused_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
josh_amused_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
josh_amused_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
josh_amused_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
josh_amused_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
josh_amused_174|They were the presage of storm.
josh_amused_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
josh_amused_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
josh_amused_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
josh_amused_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
josh_amused_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
josh_amused_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
josh_amused_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
josh_amused_183|And the air was growing chilly.
josh_amused_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
josh_amused_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
josh_amused_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
josh_amused_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
josh_amused_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
josh_amused_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
josh_amused_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
josh_amused_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
josh_amused_192|He did not rush in.
josh_amused_193|It was edged with ice.
josh_amused_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
josh_amused_195|But a strange thing happened.
josh_amused_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
josh_amused_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
josh_amused_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
josh_amused_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
josh_amused_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
josh_amused_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
josh_amused_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
josh_amused_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
josh_amused_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
josh_amused_205|From now on we're pals.
josh_amused_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
josh_amused_207|How much was it.
josh_amused_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
josh_amused_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
josh_amused_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
josh_amused_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
josh_amused_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
josh_amused_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
josh_amused_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
josh_amused_215|They die out of spite.
josh_amused_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
josh_amused_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
josh_amused_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
josh_amused_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
josh_amused_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
josh_amused_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
josh_amused_222|What part of the United States is your home.
josh_amused_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
josh_amused_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
josh_amused_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
josh_amused_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
josh_amused_228|But it contributed to the smash.
josh_amused_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
josh_amused_230|Do you know any good land around here.
josh_amused_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
josh_amused_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
josh_amused_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
josh_amused_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
josh_amused_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
josh_amused_236|Don't you see I hate you.
josh_amused_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
josh_amused_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
josh_amused_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
josh_amused_240|Wash your hands of me.
josh_amused_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
josh_amused_242|I saw it when she rolled.
josh_amused_243|I only read the quotations.
josh_amused_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
josh_amused_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
josh_amused_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
josh_amused_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
josh_amused_248|I had been sad too long already.
josh_amused_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
josh_amused_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
josh_amused_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
josh_amused_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
josh_amused_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
josh_amused_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
josh_amused_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
josh_amused_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
josh_amused_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
josh_amused_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
josh_amused_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
josh_amused_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
josh_amused_261|I have been doubly baptized.
josh_amused_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
josh_amused_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
josh_amused_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
josh_amused_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
josh_amused_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
josh_amused_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
josh_amused_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
josh_amused_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
josh_amused_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
josh_amused_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
josh_amused_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
josh_amused_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
josh_amused_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
josh_amused_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
josh_amused_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
josh_amused_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
josh_amused_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
josh_amused_279|She said with chattering teeth.
josh_amused_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
josh_amused_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
josh_amused_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
josh_amused_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
josh_amused_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
josh_amused_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
josh_amused_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
josh_amused_287|Keep an eye on him.
josh_amused_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
josh_amused_290|One by one the boys were captured.
josh_amused_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
josh_amused_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
josh_amused_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
josh_amused_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
josh_amused_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
josh_amused_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
josh_amused_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
josh_amused_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
josh_amused_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
josh_amused_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
josh_amused_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
josh_amused_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
josh_amused_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
josh_amused_304|I graduated last of my class.
josh_amused_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
josh_amused_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
josh_amused_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
josh_amused_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
josh_neutral_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
josh_neutral_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
josh_neutral_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
josh_neutral_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
josh_neutral_005|Will we ever forget it.
josh_neutral_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
josh_neutral_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
josh_neutral_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
josh_neutral_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
josh_neutral_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
josh_neutral_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
josh_neutral_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
josh_neutral_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
josh_neutral_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
josh_neutral_015|It's the aurora borealis.
josh_neutral_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
josh_neutral_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
josh_neutral_018|There was a change now.
josh_neutral_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
josh_neutral_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
josh_neutral_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
josh_neutral_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
josh_neutral_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
josh_neutral_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
josh_neutral_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
josh_neutral_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
josh_neutral_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
josh_neutral_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
josh_neutral_030|I had faith in them.
josh_neutral_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
josh_neutral_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
josh_neutral_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
josh_neutral_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
josh_neutral_036|She turned in at the hotel.
josh_neutral_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
josh_neutral_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
josh_neutral_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
josh_neutral_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
josh_neutral_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
josh_neutral_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
josh_neutral_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
josh_neutral_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
josh_neutral_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
josh_neutral_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
josh_neutral_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
josh_neutral_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
josh_neutral_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
josh_neutral_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
josh_neutral_052|It was a curious coincidence.
josh_neutral_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
josh_neutral_054|There was nothing on the rock.
josh_neutral_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
josh_neutral_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
josh_neutral_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
josh_neutral_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
josh_neutral_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
josh_neutral_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
josh_neutral_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
josh_neutral_062|The men stared into each other's face.
josh_neutral_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
josh_neutral_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
josh_neutral_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
josh_neutral_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
josh_neutral_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
josh_neutral_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
josh_neutral_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
josh_neutral_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
josh_neutral_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
josh_neutral_072|But who was Eileen's double.
josh_neutral_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
josh_neutral_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
josh_neutral_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
josh_neutral_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
josh_neutral_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
josh_neutral_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
josh_neutral_079|It was a large canoe.
josh_neutral_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
josh_neutral_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
josh_neutral_082|His face was streaming with blood.
josh_neutral_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
josh_neutral_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
josh_neutral_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
josh_neutral_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
josh_neutral_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
josh_neutral_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
josh_neutral_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
josh_neutral_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
josh_neutral_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
josh_neutral_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
josh_neutral_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
josh_neutral_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
josh_neutral_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
josh_neutral_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
josh_neutral_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
josh_neutral_098|Shall I carry you.
josh_neutral_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
josh_neutral_100|You must sleep  he urged.
josh_neutral_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
josh_neutral_102|He will follow us soon.
josh_neutral_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
josh_neutral_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
josh_neutral_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
josh_neutral_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
josh_neutral_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
josh_neutral_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
josh_neutral_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
josh_neutral_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
josh_neutral_112|He was wounded in the arm.
josh_neutral_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
josh_neutral_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
josh_neutral_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
josh_neutral_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
josh_neutral_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
josh_neutral_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
josh_neutral_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
josh_neutral_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
josh_neutral_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
josh_neutral_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
josh_neutral_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
josh_neutral_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
josh_neutral_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
josh_neutral_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
josh_neutral_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
josh_neutral_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
josh_neutral_129|Her face was against his breast.
josh_neutral_130|She was his now  forever.
josh_neutral_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
josh_neutral_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
josh_neutral_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
josh_neutral_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
josh_neutral_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
josh_neutral_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
josh_neutral_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
josh_neutral_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
josh_neutral_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
josh_neutral_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
josh_neutral_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
josh_neutral_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
josh_neutral_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
josh_neutral_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
josh_neutral_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
josh_neutral_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
josh_neutral_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
josh_neutral_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
josh_neutral_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
josh_neutral_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
josh_neutral_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
josh_neutral_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
josh_neutral_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
josh_neutral_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
josh_neutral_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
josh_neutral_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
josh_neutral_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
josh_neutral_158|Does that look good.
josh_neutral_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
josh_neutral_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
josh_neutral_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
josh_neutral_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
josh_neutral_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
josh_neutral_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
josh_neutral_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
josh_neutral_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
josh_neutral_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
josh_neutral_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
josh_neutral_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
josh_neutral_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
josh_neutral_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
josh_neutral_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
josh_neutral_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
josh_neutral_174|They were the presage of storm.
josh_neutral_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
josh_neutral_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
josh_neutral_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
josh_neutral_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
josh_neutral_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
josh_neutral_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
josh_neutral_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
josh_neutral_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
josh_neutral_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
josh_neutral_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
josh_neutral_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
josh_neutral_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
josh_neutral_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
josh_neutral_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
josh_neutral_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
josh_neutral_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
josh_neutral_192|He did not rush in.
josh_neutral_193|It was edged with ice.
josh_neutral_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
josh_neutral_195|But a strange thing happened.
josh_neutral_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
josh_neutral_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
josh_neutral_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
josh_neutral_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
josh_neutral_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
josh_neutral_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
josh_neutral_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
josh_neutral_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
josh_neutral_205|From now on we're pals.
josh_neutral_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
josh_neutral_207|How much was it.
josh_neutral_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
josh_neutral_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
josh_neutral_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
josh_neutral_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
josh_neutral_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
josh_neutral_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
josh_neutral_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
josh_neutral_215|They die out of spite.
josh_neutral_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
josh_neutral_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
josh_neutral_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
josh_neutral_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
josh_neutral_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
josh_neutral_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
josh_neutral_222|What part of the United States is your home.
josh_neutral_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
josh_neutral_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
josh_neutral_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
josh_neutral_226|That came before my A B C's.
josh_neutral_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
josh_neutral_228|But it contributed to the smash.
josh_neutral_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
josh_neutral_230|Do you know any good land around here.
josh_neutral_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
josh_neutral_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
josh_neutral_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
josh_neutral_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
josh_neutral_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
josh_neutral_236|Don't you see I hate you.
josh_neutral_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.

josh_neutral_240|Wash your hands of me.
josh_neutral_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
josh_neutral_242|I saw it when she rolled.
josh_neutral_243|I only read the quotations.
josh_neutral_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
josh_neutral_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
josh_neutral_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
josh_neutral_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
josh_neutral_248|I had been sad too long already.
josh_neutral_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
josh_neutral_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
josh_neutral_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
josh_neutral_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
josh_neutral_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
josh_neutral_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
josh_neutral_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
josh_neutral_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
josh_neutral_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
josh_neutral_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
josh_neutral_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
josh_neutral_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
josh_neutral_261|I have been doubly baptized.
josh_neutral_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
josh_neutral_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
josh_neutral_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
josh_neutral_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
josh_neutral_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
josh_neutral_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
josh_neutral_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
josh_neutral_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
josh_neutral_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
josh_neutral_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
josh_neutral_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
josh_neutral_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
josh_neutral_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
josh_neutral_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
josh_neutral_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
josh_neutral_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
josh_neutral_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
josh_neutral_279|She said with chattering teeth.
josh_neutral_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
josh_neutral_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
josh_neutral_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
josh_neutral_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
josh_neutral_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
josh_neutral_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
josh_neutral_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
josh_neutral_287|Keep an eye on him.
josh_neutral_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
josh_neutral_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
josh_neutral_290|One by one the boys were captured.
josh_neutral_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
josh_neutral_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
josh_neutral_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
josh_neutral_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
josh_neutral_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
josh_neutral_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
josh_neutral_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
josh_neutral_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
josh_neutral_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
josh_neutral_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
josh_neutral_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
josh_neutral_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
josh_neutral_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
josh_neutral_304|I graduated last of my class.
josh_neutral_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
josh_neutral_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
josh_neutral_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
josh_neutral_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
josh_sleepiness_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
josh_sleepiness_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
josh_sleepiness_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
josh_sleepiness_005|Will we ever forget it.
josh_sleepiness_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
josh_sleepiness_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
josh_sleepiness_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
josh_sleepiness_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
josh_sleepiness_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
josh_sleepiness_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
josh_sleepiness_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
josh_sleepiness_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
josh_sleepiness_015|It's the aurora borealis.
josh_sleepiness_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
josh_sleepiness_018|There was a change now.
josh_sleepiness_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
josh_sleepiness_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
josh_sleepiness_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
josh_sleepiness_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
josh_sleepiness_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
josh_sleepiness_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
josh_sleepiness_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
josh_sleepiness_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
josh_sleepiness_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
josh_sleepiness_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
josh_sleepiness_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
josh_sleepiness_030|I had faith in them.
josh_sleepiness_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
josh_sleepiness_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
josh_sleepiness_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
josh_sleepiness_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
josh_sleepiness_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
josh_sleepiness_036|She turned in at the hotel.
josh_sleepiness_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
josh_sleepiness_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
josh_sleepiness_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
josh_sleepiness_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
josh_sleepiness_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
josh_sleepiness_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
josh_sleepiness_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
josh_sleepiness_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
josh_sleepiness_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
josh_sleepiness_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
josh_sleepiness_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
josh_sleepiness_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
josh_sleepiness_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
josh_sleepiness_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
josh_sleepiness_052|It was a curious coincidence.
josh_sleepiness_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
josh_sleepiness_054|There was nothing on the rock.
josh_sleepiness_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
josh_sleepiness_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
josh_sleepiness_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
josh_sleepiness_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
josh_sleepiness_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
josh_sleepiness_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
josh_sleepiness_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
josh_sleepiness_062|The men stared into each other's face.
josh_sleepiness_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
josh_sleepiness_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
josh_sleepiness_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
josh_sleepiness_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
josh_sleepiness_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
josh_sleepiness_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
josh_sleepiness_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
josh_sleepiness_072|But who was Eileen's double.
josh_sleepiness_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
josh_sleepiness_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
josh_sleepiness_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
josh_sleepiness_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
josh_sleepiness_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
josh_sleepiness_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
josh_sleepiness_079|It was a large canoe.
josh_sleepiness_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
josh_sleepiness_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
josh_sleepiness_082|His face was streaming with blood.
josh_sleepiness_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
josh_sleepiness_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
josh_sleepiness_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
josh_sleepiness_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
josh_sleepiness_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
josh_sleepiness_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
josh_sleepiness_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
josh_sleepiness_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
josh_sleepiness_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
josh_sleepiness_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
josh_sleepiness_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
josh_sleepiness_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
josh_sleepiness_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
josh_sleepiness_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
josh_sleepiness_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
josh_sleepiness_098|Shall I carry you.
josh_sleepiness_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
josh_sleepiness_100|You must sleep  he urged.
josh_sleepiness_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
josh_sleepiness_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
josh_sleepiness_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
josh_sleepiness_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
josh_sleepiness_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
josh_sleepiness_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
josh_sleepiness_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
josh_sleepiness_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
josh_sleepiness_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
josh_sleepiness_112|He was wounded in the arm.
josh_sleepiness_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
josh_sleepiness_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
josh_sleepiness_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
josh_sleepiness_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
josh_sleepiness_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
josh_sleepiness_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
josh_sleepiness_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
josh_sleepiness_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
josh_sleepiness_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
josh_sleepiness_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
josh_sleepiness_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
josh_sleepiness_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
josh_sleepiness_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
josh_sleepiness_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
josh_sleepiness_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
josh_sleepiness_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
josh_sleepiness_129|Her face was against his breast.
josh_sleepiness_130|She was his now  forever.
josh_sleepiness_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
josh_sleepiness_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
josh_sleepiness_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
josh_sleepiness_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
josh_sleepiness_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
josh_sleepiness_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
josh_sleepiness_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
josh_sleepiness_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
josh_sleepiness_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
josh_sleepiness_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
josh_sleepiness_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
josh_sleepiness_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
josh_sleepiness_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
josh_sleepiness_174|They were the presage of storm.
josh_sleepiness_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
josh_sleepiness_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
josh_sleepiness_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
josh_sleepiness_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
josh_sleepiness_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
josh_sleepiness_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
josh_sleepiness_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
josh_sleepiness_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
josh_sleepiness_183|And the air was growing chilly.
josh_sleepiness_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
josh_sleepiness_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
josh_sleepiness_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
josh_sleepiness_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
josh_sleepiness_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
josh_sleepiness_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
josh_sleepiness_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
josh_sleepiness_192|He did not rush in.
josh_sleepiness_193|It was edged with ice.
josh_sleepiness_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
josh_sleepiness_195|But a strange thing happened.
josh_sleepiness_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
josh_sleepiness_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
josh_sleepiness_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
josh_sleepiness_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
josh_sleepiness_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
josh_sleepiness_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
josh_sleepiness_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
josh_sleepiness_205|From now on we're pals.
josh_sleepiness_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
josh_sleepiness_207|How much was it.
josh_sleepiness_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
josh_sleepiness_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
josh_sleepiness_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
josh_sleepiness_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
josh_sleepiness_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
josh_sleepiness_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
josh_sleepiness_215|They die out of spite.
josh_sleepiness_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
josh_sleepiness_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
josh_sleepiness_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
josh_sleepiness_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
josh_sleepiness_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
josh_sleepiness_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
josh_sleepiness_222|What part of the United States is your home.
josh_sleepiness_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
josh_sleepiness_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
josh_sleepiness_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
josh_sleepiness_226|That came before my A B C's.
josh_sleepiness_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
josh_sleepiness_228|But it contributed to the smash.
josh_sleepiness_230|Do you know any good land around here.
josh_sleepiness_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
josh_sleepiness_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
josh_sleepiness_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
josh_sleepiness_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
josh_sleepiness_236|Don't you see I hate you.
josh_sleepiness_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
josh_sleepiness_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
josh_sleepiness_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
josh_sleepiness_240|Wash your hands of me.
josh_sleepiness_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
josh_sleepiness_242|I saw it when she rolled.
josh_sleepiness_243|I only read the quotations.
josh_sleepiness_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
josh_sleepiness_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
josh_sleepiness_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
josh_sleepiness_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
josh_sleepiness_248|I had been sad too long already.
josh_sleepiness_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.

josh_sleepiness_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
josh_sleepiness_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
josh_sleepiness_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
josh_sleepiness_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
josh_sleepiness_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
josh_sleepiness_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
josh_sleepiness_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
josh_sleepiness_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
josh_sleepiness_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
josh_sleepiness_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
josh_sleepiness_261|I have been doubly baptized.

josh_sleepiness_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
josh_sleepiness_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
josh_sleepiness_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
josh_sleepiness_279|She said with chattering teeth.
josh_sleepiness_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
josh_sleepiness_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
josh_sleepiness_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
josh_sleepiness_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.

sam_amused_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
sam_amused_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
sam_amused_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
sam_amused_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
sam_amused_005|Will we ever forget it.
sam_amused_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
sam_amused_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
sam_amused_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
sam_amused_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
sam_amused_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.

sam_amused_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.

sam_amused_015|It's the aurora borealis.
sam_amused_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
sam_amused_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
sam_amused_018|There was a change now.
sam_amused_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.

sam_amused_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
sam_amused_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
sam_amused_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
sam_amused_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
sam_amused_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
sam_amused_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
sam_amused_052|It was a curious coincidence.
sam_amused_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
sam_amused_054|There was nothing on the rock.
sam_amused_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
sam_amused_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
sam_amused_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
sam_amused_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
sam_amused_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
sam_amused_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
sam_amused_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
sam_amused_062|The men stared into each other's face.
sam_amused_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
sam_amused_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
sam_amused_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
sam_amused_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
sam_amused_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
sam_amused_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
sam_amused_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
sam_amused_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
sam_amused_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
sam_amused_072|But who was Eileen's double.
sam_amused_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
sam_amused_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
sam_amused_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
sam_amused_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
sam_amused_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
sam_amused_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
sam_amused_079|It was a large canoe.
sam_amused_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
sam_amused_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
sam_amused_082|His face was streaming with blood.
sam_amused_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
sam_amused_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
sam_amused_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
sam_amused_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
sam_amused_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
sam_amused_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
sam_amused_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
sam_amused_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
sam_amused_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
sam_amused_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
sam_amused_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
sam_amused_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
sam_amused_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
sam_amused_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
sam_amused_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
sam_amused_098|Shall I carry you.
sam_amused_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
sam_amused_100|You must sleep  he urged.
sam_amused_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
sam_amused_102|He will follow us soon.
sam_amused_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
sam_amused_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
sam_amused_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
sam_amused_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
sam_amused_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
sam_amused_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
sam_amused_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
sam_amused_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
sam_amused_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
sam_amused_112|He was wounded in the arm.
sam_amused_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
sam_amused_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
sam_amused_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
sam_amused_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
sam_amused_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
sam_amused_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
sam_amused_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
sam_amused_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
sam_amused_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
sam_amused_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
sam_amused_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
sam_amused_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
sam_amused_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
sam_amused_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
sam_amused_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
sam_amused_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
sam_amused_129|Her face was against his breast.
sam_amused_130|She was his now  forever.
sam_amused_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
sam_amused_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
sam_amused_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
sam_amused_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
sam_amused_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
sam_amused_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
sam_amused_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
sam_amused_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
sam_amused_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
sam_amused_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
sam_amused_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
sam_amused_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
sam_amused_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
sam_amused_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
sam_amused_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
sam_amused_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
sam_amused_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
sam_amused_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
sam_amused_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
sam_amused_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
sam_amused_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
sam_amused_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
sam_amused_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
sam_amused_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
sam_amused_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
sam_amused_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
sam_amused_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
sam_amused_158|Does that look good.
sam_amused_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
sam_amused_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
sam_amused_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
sam_amused_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
sam_amused_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
sam_amused_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
sam_amused_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
sam_amused_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
sam_amused_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
sam_amused_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
sam_amused_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
sam_amused_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
sam_amused_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
sam_amused_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
sam_amused_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
sam_amused_174|They were the presage of storm.
sam_amused_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
sam_amused_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
sam_amused_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
sam_amused_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
sam_amused_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
sam_amused_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
sam_amused_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
sam_amused_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
sam_amused_183|And the air was growing chilly.
sam_amused_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
sam_amused_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
sam_amused_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
sam_amused_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
sam_amused_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
sam_amused_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
sam_amused_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
sam_amused_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
sam_amused_192|He did not rush in.
sam_amused_193|It was edged with ice.
sam_amused_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
sam_amused_195|But a strange thing happened.
sam_amused_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
sam_amused_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
sam_amused_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
sam_amused_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
sam_amused_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
sam_amused_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
sam_amused_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
sam_amused_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
sam_amused_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
sam_amused_205|From now on we're pals.
sam_amused_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
sam_amused_207|How much was it.
sam_amused_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
sam_amused_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
sam_amused_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
sam_amused_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
sam_amused_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
sam_amused_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
sam_amused_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
sam_amused_215|They die out of spite.
sam_amused_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
sam_amused_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
sam_amused_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
sam_amused_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
sam_amused_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
sam_amused_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
sam_amused_222|What part of the United States is your home.
sam_amused_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
sam_amused_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
sam_amused_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
sam_amused_226|That came before my A B C's.
sam_amused_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
sam_amused_228|But it contributed to the smash.
sam_amused_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
sam_amused_230|Do you know any good land around here.
sam_amused_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
sam_amused_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
sam_amused_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
sam_amused_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
sam_amused_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
sam_amused_236|Don't you see I hate you.
sam_amused_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
sam_amused_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
sam_amused_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
sam_amused_240|Wash your hands of me.
sam_amused_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
sam_amused_242|I saw it when she rolled.
sam_amused_243|I only read the quotations.
sam_amused_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
sam_amused_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
sam_amused_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
sam_amused_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
sam_amused_248|I had been sad too long already.
sam_amused_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
sam_amused_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
sam_amused_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
sam_amused_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
sam_amused_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
sam_amused_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
sam_amused_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
sam_amused_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
sam_amused_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
sam_amused_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
sam_amused_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
sam_amused_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
sam_amused_261|I have been doubly baptized.
sam_amused_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
sam_amused_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
sam_amused_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
sam_amused_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
sam_amused_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
sam_amused_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
sam_amused_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
sam_amused_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
sam_amused_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
sam_amused_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
sam_amused_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
sam_amused_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
sam_amused_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
sam_amused_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
sam_amused_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
sam_amused_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
sam_amused_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
sam_amused_279|She said with chattering teeth.
sam_amused_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
sam_amused_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
sam_amused_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
sam_amused_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
sam_amused_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
sam_amused_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
sam_amused_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
sam_amused_287|Keep an eye on him.
sam_amused_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
sam_amused_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
sam_amused_290|One by one the boys were captured.
sam_amused_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
sam_amused_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
sam_amused_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
sam_amused_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
sam_amused_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
sam_amused_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
sam_amused_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
sam_amused_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
sam_amused_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
sam_amused_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
sam_amused_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
sam_amused_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
sam_amused_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
sam_amused_304|I graduated last of my class.
sam_amused_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
sam_amused_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
sam_amused_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
sam_amused_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
sam_amused_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
sam_amused_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
sam_amused_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
sam_amused_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
sam_amused_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
sam_amused_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
sam_amused_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
sam_amused_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
sam_amused_317|He was a wise hyena.
sam_amused_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
sam_amused_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
sam_amused_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
sam_amused_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
sam_amused_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
sam_amused_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
sam_amused_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
sam_amused_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
sam_amused_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
sam_amused_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
sam_amused_329|Ah  indeed.
sam_amused_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
sam_amused_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
sam_amused_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
sam_amused_333|This is no place for you.
sam_amused_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
sam_amused_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
sam_amused_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
sam_amused_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
sam_amused_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
sam_amused_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
sam_amused_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
sam_amused_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
sam_amused_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
sam_amused_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
sam_amused_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
sam_amused_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
sam_amused_346|Get down and dig in.
sam_amused_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
sam_amused_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
sam_amused_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
sam_amused_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
sam_amused_351|It was more like sugar.
sam_amused_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
sam_amused_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
sam_amused_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
sam_amused_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
sam_amused_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
sam_amused_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
sam_amused_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
sam_amused_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
sam_amused_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
sam_amused_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
sam_amused_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
sam_amused_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
sam_amused_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
sam_amused_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
sam_amused_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
sam_amused_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
sam_amused_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
sam_amused_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
sam_amused_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
sam_amused_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
sam_amused_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
sam_amused_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
sam_amused_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
sam_amused_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
sam_amused_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
sam_amused_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
sam_amused_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
sam_amused_379|How old are you  daddy.
sam_amused_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
sam_amused_381|My name's Ferguson.
sam_amused_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
sam_amused_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
sam_amused_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
sam_amused_385|That's what Carnegie did.
sam_amused_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
sam_amused_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
sam_amused_388|It was my idea to a tee.
sam_amused_389|Mab  she said.
sam_amused_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
sam_amused_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
sam_amused_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
sam_amused_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
sam_amused_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
sam_amused_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
sam_amused_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
sam_amused_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
sam_amused_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
sam_amused_399|And here's another idea.
sam_amused_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
sam_amused_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
sam_amused_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
sam_amused_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
sam_amused_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
sam_amused_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
sam_amused_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
sam_amused_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
sam_amused_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
sam_amused_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
sam_amused_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
sam_amused_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
sam_amused_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
sam_amused_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
sam_amused_414|Now our figuring was all right.
sam_amused_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
sam_amused_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
sam_amused_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
sam_amused_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
sam_amused_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
sam_amused_421|By golly  the boy wins.
sam_amused_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
sam_amused_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
sam_amused_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
sam_amused_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
sam_amused_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
sam_amused_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
sam_amused_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
sam_amused_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
sam_amused_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
sam_amused_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
sam_amused_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
sam_amused_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
sam_amused_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
sam_amused_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
sam_amused_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
sam_amused_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
sam_amused_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
sam_amused_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
sam_amused_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
sam_amused_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
sam_amused_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
sam_amused_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
sam_amused_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
sam_amused_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
sam_amused_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
sam_amused_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
sam_amused_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
sam_amused_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
sam_amused_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
sam_amused_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
sam_amused_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
sam_amused_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
sam_amused_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
sam_amused_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
sam_amused_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
sam_amused_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
sam_amused_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
sam_amused_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
sam_amused_460|I had forgotten their existence.
sam_amused_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
sam_amused_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
sam_amused_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
sam_amused_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
sam_amused_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
sam_amused_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
sam_amused_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
sam_amused_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
sam_amused_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
sam_amused_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
sam_amused_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
sam_amused_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
sam_amused_473|The night was calm and snowy.
sam_amused_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
sam_amused_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
sam_amused_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
sam_amused_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
sam_amused_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
sam_amused_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
sam_amused_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
sam_amused_481|Nimrod replied  with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
sam_amused_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
sam_amused_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
sam_amused_484|No-sir-ee.
sam_amused_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
sam_amused_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
sam_amused_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
sam_amused_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
sam_amused_489|They were artists  not biologists.
sam_amused_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
sam_amused_491|And as in denial of guilt  the one-legged boy replied.
sam_amused_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
sam_amused_493|The boy  O'Brien  was specially maltreated.
sam_amused_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
sam_amused_495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
sam_amused_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
sam_amused_497|King took every advantage he knew.
sam_amused_498|The lines were now very taut.
sam_amused_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
sam_amused_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
sam_amused_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
sam_amused_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
sam_amused_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
sam_amused_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
sam_disgust_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
sam_disgust_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
sam_disgust_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
sam_disgust_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
sam_disgust_005|Will we ever forget it.
sam_disgust_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
sam_disgust_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
sam_disgust_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
sam_disgust_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
sam_disgust_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
sam_disgust_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
sam_disgust_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
sam_disgust_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
sam_disgust_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
sam_disgust_015|It's the aurora borealis.
sam_disgust_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
sam_disgust_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
sam_disgust_018|There was a change now.
sam_disgust_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
sam_disgust_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
sam_disgust_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
sam_disgust_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
sam_disgust_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
sam_disgust_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
sam_disgust_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
sam_disgust_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
sam_disgust_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
sam_disgust_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
sam_disgust_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
sam_disgust_030|I had faith in them.
sam_disgust_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
sam_disgust_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
sam_disgust_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
sam_disgust_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
sam_disgust_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
sam_disgust_036|She turned in at the hotel.
sam_disgust_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
sam_disgust_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
sam_disgust_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
sam_disgust_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
sam_disgust_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
sam_disgust_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
sam_disgust_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
sam_disgust_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
sam_disgust_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
sam_disgust_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
sam_disgust_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
sam_disgust_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
sam_disgust_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
sam_disgust_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
sam_disgust_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
sam_disgust_052|It was a curious coincidence.
sam_disgust_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
sam_disgust_054|There was nothing on the rock.
sam_disgust_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
sam_disgust_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
sam_disgust_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
sam_disgust_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
sam_disgust_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
sam_disgust_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
sam_disgust_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
sam_disgust_062|The men stared into each other's face.
sam_disgust_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
sam_disgust_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
sam_disgust_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
sam_disgust_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
sam_disgust_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
sam_disgust_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
sam_disgust_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
sam_disgust_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
sam_disgust_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
sam_disgust_072|But who was Eileen's double.
sam_disgust_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
sam_disgust_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
sam_disgust_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
sam_disgust_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
sam_disgust_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
sam_disgust_079|It was a large canoe.
sam_disgust_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
sam_disgust_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
sam_disgust_082|His face was streaming with blood.
sam_disgust_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
sam_disgust_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
sam_disgust_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
sam_disgust_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
sam_disgust_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
sam_disgust_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
sam_disgust_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
sam_disgust_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
sam_disgust_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
sam_disgust_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
sam_disgust_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
sam_disgust_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
sam_disgust_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
sam_disgust_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
sam_disgust_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
sam_disgust_098|Shall I carry you.
sam_disgust_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
sam_disgust_100|You must sleep  he urged.
sam_disgust_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
sam_disgust_102|He will follow us soon.
sam_disgust_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
sam_disgust_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
sam_disgust_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
sam_disgust_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
sam_disgust_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
sam_disgust_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
sam_disgust_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
sam_disgust_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
sam_disgust_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
sam_disgust_112|He was wounded in the arm.
sam_disgust_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
sam_disgust_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
sam_disgust_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
sam_disgust_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
sam_disgust_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
sam_disgust_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
sam_disgust_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
sam_disgust_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
sam_disgust_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
sam_disgust_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
sam_disgust_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
sam_disgust_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
sam_disgust_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
sam_disgust_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
sam_disgust_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
sam_disgust_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
sam_disgust_129|Her face was against his breast.
sam_disgust_130|She was his now  forever.
sam_disgust_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
sam_disgust_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
sam_disgust_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
sam_disgust_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
sam_disgust_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
sam_disgust_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
sam_disgust_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
sam_disgust_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
sam_disgust_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
sam_disgust_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
sam_disgust_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
sam_disgust_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
sam_disgust_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
sam_disgust_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
sam_disgust_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
sam_disgust_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
sam_disgust_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
sam_disgust_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
sam_disgust_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
sam_disgust_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
sam_disgust_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
sam_disgust_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
sam_disgust_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
sam_disgust_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
sam_disgust_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
sam_disgust_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
sam_disgust_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
sam_disgust_158|Does that look good.
sam_disgust_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
sam_disgust_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
sam_disgust_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
sam_disgust_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
sam_disgust_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
sam_disgust_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
sam_disgust_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
sam_disgust_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
sam_disgust_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
sam_disgust_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
sam_disgust_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
sam_disgust_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
sam_disgust_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
sam_disgust_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
sam_disgust_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
sam_disgust_174|They were the presage of storm.
sam_disgust_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
sam_disgust_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
sam_disgust_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
sam_disgust_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
sam_disgust_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
sam_disgust_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
sam_disgust_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
sam_disgust_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
sam_disgust_183|And the air was growing chilly.
sam_disgust_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
sam_disgust_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
sam_disgust_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
sam_disgust_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
sam_disgust_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
sam_disgust_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
sam_disgust_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
sam_disgust_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
sam_disgust_192|He did not rush in.
sam_disgust_193|It was edged with ice.
sam_disgust_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
sam_disgust_195|But a strange thing happened.
sam_disgust_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
sam_disgust_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
sam_disgust_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
sam_disgust_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
sam_disgust_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
sam_disgust_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
sam_disgust_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
sam_disgust_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
sam_disgust_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
sam_disgust_205|From now on we're pals.
sam_disgust_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
sam_disgust_207|How much was it.
sam_disgust_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
sam_disgust_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
sam_disgust_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
sam_disgust_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
sam_disgust_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
sam_disgust_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
sam_disgust_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
sam_disgust_215|They die out of spite.
sam_disgust_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
sam_disgust_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
sam_disgust_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
sam_disgust_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
sam_disgust_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
sam_disgust_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
sam_disgust_222|What part of the United States is your home.
sam_disgust_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
sam_disgust_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
sam_disgust_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
sam_disgust_226|That came before my A B C's.
sam_disgust_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
sam_disgust_228|But it contributed to the smash.
sam_disgust_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
sam_disgust_230|Do you know any good land around here.
sam_disgust_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
sam_disgust_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
sam_disgust_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
sam_disgust_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
sam_disgust_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
sam_disgust_236|Don't you see I hate you.
sam_disgust_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
sam_disgust_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
sam_disgust_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
sam_disgust_240|Wash your hands of me.
sam_disgust_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
sam_disgust_242|I saw it when she rolled.
sam_disgust_243|I only read the quotations.
sam_disgust_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
sam_disgust_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
sam_disgust_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
sam_disgust_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
sam_disgust_248|I had been sad too long already.
sam_disgust_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
sam_disgust_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
sam_disgust_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
sam_disgust_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
sam_disgust_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
sam_disgust_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
sam_disgust_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
sam_disgust_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
sam_disgust_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
sam_disgust_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
sam_disgust_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
sam_disgust_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
sam_disgust_261|I have been doubly baptized.
sam_disgust_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
sam_disgust_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
sam_disgust_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
sam_disgust_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
sam_disgust_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
sam_disgust_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
sam_disgust_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
sam_disgust_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
sam_disgust_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
sam_disgust_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
sam_disgust_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
sam_disgust_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
sam_disgust_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
sam_disgust_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
sam_disgust_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
sam_disgust_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
sam_disgust_279|She said with chattering teeth.
sam_disgust_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
sam_disgust_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
sam_disgust_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
sam_disgust_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
sam_disgust_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
sam_disgust_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
sam_disgust_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
sam_disgust_287|Keep an eye on him.
sam_disgust_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
sam_disgust_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
sam_disgust_290|One by one the boys were captured.
sam_disgust_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
sam_disgust_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
sam_disgust_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
sam_disgust_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
sam_disgust_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
sam_disgust_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
sam_disgust_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
sam_disgust_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
sam_disgust_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
sam_disgust_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
sam_disgust_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
sam_disgust_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
sam_disgust_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
sam_disgust_304|I graduated last of my class.
sam_disgust_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
sam_disgust_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
sam_disgust_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
sam_disgust_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
sam_disgust_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
sam_disgust_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
sam_disgust_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
sam_disgust_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
sam_disgust_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
sam_disgust_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
sam_disgust_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
sam_disgust_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
sam_disgust_317|He was a wise hyena.
sam_disgust_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
sam_disgust_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
sam_disgust_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
sam_disgust_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
sam_disgust_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
sam_disgust_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
sam_disgust_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
sam_disgust_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
sam_disgust_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
sam_disgust_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
sam_disgust_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
sam_disgust_329|Ah  indeed.
sam_disgust_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
sam_disgust_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
sam_disgust_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
sam_disgust_333|This is no place for you.
sam_disgust_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
sam_disgust_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
sam_disgust_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
sam_disgust_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
sam_disgust_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
sam_disgust_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
sam_disgust_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
sam_disgust_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
sam_disgust_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
sam_disgust_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
sam_disgust_346|Get down and dig in.
sam_disgust_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
sam_disgust_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
sam_disgust_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
sam_disgust_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
sam_disgust_351|It was more like sugar.
sam_disgust_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
sam_disgust_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
sam_disgust_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
sam_disgust_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
sam_disgust_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
sam_disgust_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
sam_disgust_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
sam_disgust_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
sam_disgust_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
sam_disgust_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
sam_disgust_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
sam_disgust_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
sam_disgust_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
sam_disgust_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
sam_disgust_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
sam_disgust_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
sam_disgust_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
sam_disgust_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
sam_disgust_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
sam_disgust_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
sam_disgust_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
sam_disgust_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
sam_disgust_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
sam_disgust_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
sam_disgust_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
sam_disgust_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
sam_disgust_379|How old are you  daddy.
sam_disgust_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
sam_disgust_381|My name's Ferguson.
sam_disgust_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
sam_disgust_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
sam_disgust_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
sam_disgust_385|That's what Carnegie did.
sam_disgust_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
sam_disgust_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
sam_disgust_388|It was my idea to a tee.
sam_disgust_389|Mab  she said.
sam_disgust_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
sam_disgust_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
sam_disgust_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
sam_disgust_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
sam_disgust_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
sam_disgust_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
sam_disgust_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
sam_disgust_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
sam_disgust_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
sam_disgust_399|And here's another idea.
sam_disgust_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
sam_disgust_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
sam_disgust_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
sam_disgust_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
sam_disgust_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
sam_disgust_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
sam_disgust_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
sam_disgust_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
sam_disgust_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
sam_disgust_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
sam_disgust_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
sam_disgust_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
sam_disgust_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
sam_disgust_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
sam_disgust_414|Now our figuring was all right.
sam_disgust_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
sam_disgust_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
sam_disgust_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
sam_disgust_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
sam_disgust_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
sam_disgust_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
sam_disgust_421|By golly  the boy wins.
sam_disgust_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
sam_disgust_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
sam_disgust_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
sam_disgust_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
sam_disgust_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
sam_disgust_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
sam_disgust_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
sam_disgust_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
sam_disgust_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
sam_disgust_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
sam_disgust_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
sam_disgust_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
sam_disgust_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
sam_disgust_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
sam_disgust_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
sam_disgust_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
sam_disgust_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
sam_disgust_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
sam_disgust_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
sam_disgust_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
sam_disgust_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
sam_disgust_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
sam_disgust_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
sam_disgust_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
sam_disgust_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
sam_disgust_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
sam_disgust_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
sam_disgust_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
sam_disgust_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
sam_disgust_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
sam_disgust_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
sam_disgust_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
sam_disgust_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
sam_disgust_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
sam_disgust_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
sam_disgust_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
sam_disgust_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
sam_disgust_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
sam_disgust_460|I had forgotten their existence.
sam_disgust_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
sam_disgust_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
sam_disgust_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
sam_disgust_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
sam_disgust_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
sam_disgust_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
sam_disgust_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
sam_disgust_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
sam_disgust_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
sam_disgust_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
sam_disgust_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
sam_disgust_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
sam_disgust_473|The night was calm and snowy.
sam_disgust_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
sam_disgust_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
sam_disgust_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
sam_disgust_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
sam_disgust_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
sam_disgust_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
sam_disgust_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
sam_disgust_481|Nimrod replied  with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
sam_disgust_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
sam_disgust_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
sam_disgust_484|No-sir-ee.
sam_disgust_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
sam_disgust_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
sam_disgust_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
sam_disgust_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
sam_disgust_489|They were artists  not biologists.
sam_disgust_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
sam_disgust_491|And as in denial of guilt  the one-legged boy replied.
sam_disgust_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
sam_disgust_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
sam_disgust_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
sam_disgust_497|King took every advantage he knew.
sam_disgust_498|The lines were now very taut.
sam_disgust_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
sam_disgust_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
sam_disgust_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
sam_disgust_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
sam_disgust_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
sam_disgust_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
sam_neutral_001|Author of the danger trail  Philip Steels  etc.
sam_neutral_003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
sam_neutral_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
sam_neutral_005|Will we ever forget it.
sam_neutral_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
sam_neutral_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
sam_neutral_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
sam_neutral_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
sam_neutral_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
sam_neutral_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
sam_neutral_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
sam_neutral_015|It's the aurora borealis.
sam_neutral_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
sam_neutral_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
sam_neutral_018|There was a change now.
sam_neutral_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
sam_neutral_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
sam_neutral_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
sam_neutral_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
sam_neutral_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
sam_neutral_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
sam_neutral_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
sam_neutral_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
sam_neutral_030|I had faith in them.
sam_neutral_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
sam_neutral_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
sam_neutral_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
sam_neutral_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
sam_neutral_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
sam_neutral_036|She turned in at the hotel.
sam_neutral_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
sam_neutral_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
sam_neutral_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
sam_neutral_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
sam_neutral_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
sam_neutral_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
sam_neutral_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
sam_neutral_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
sam_neutral_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
sam_neutral_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
sam_neutral_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
sam_neutral_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
sam_neutral_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
sam_neutral_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
sam_neutral_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
sam_neutral_052|It was a curious coincidence.
sam_neutral_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
sam_neutral_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
sam_neutral_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
sam_neutral_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
sam_neutral_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
sam_neutral_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
sam_neutral_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
sam_neutral_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
sam_neutral_062|The men stared into each other's face.
sam_neutral_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
sam_neutral_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
sam_neutral_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
sam_neutral_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
sam_neutral_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
sam_neutral_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
sam_neutral_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
sam_neutral_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
sam_neutral_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
sam_neutral_072|But who was Eileen's double.
sam_neutral_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
sam_neutral_074|And now  down there  Eileen was waiting for him.
sam_neutral_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
sam_neutral_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
sam_neutral_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
sam_neutral_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
sam_neutral_079|It was a large canoe.
sam_neutral_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
sam_neutral_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
sam_neutral_082|His face was streaming with blood.
sam_neutral_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
sam_neutral_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
sam_neutral_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
sam_neutral_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
sam_neutral_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
sam_neutral_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
sam_neutral_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
sam_neutral_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
sam_neutral_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
sam_neutral_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
sam_neutral_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
sam_neutral_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
sam_neutral_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
sam_neutral_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
sam_neutral_097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
sam_neutral_098|Shall I carry you.
sam_neutral_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
sam_neutral_100|You must sleep  he urged.
sam_neutral_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
sam_neutral_102|He will follow us soon.
sam_neutral_103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
sam_neutral_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
sam_neutral_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
sam_neutral_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
sam_neutral_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
sam_neutral_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
sam_neutral_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
sam_neutral_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
sam_neutral_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
sam_neutral_112|He was wounded in the arm.
sam_neutral_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
sam_neutral_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
sam_neutral_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
sam_neutral_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
sam_neutral_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
sam_neutral_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
sam_neutral_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
sam_neutral_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
sam_neutral_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
sam_neutral_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
sam_neutral_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
sam_neutral_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
sam_neutral_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
sam_neutral_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
sam_neutral_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
sam_neutral_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
sam_neutral_129|Her face was against his breast.
sam_neutral_130|She was his now  forever.
sam_neutral_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
sam_neutral_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
sam_neutral_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
sam_neutral_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
sam_neutral_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
sam_neutral_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
sam_neutral_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
sam_neutral_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
sam_neutral_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
sam_neutral_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
sam_neutral_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
sam_neutral_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
sam_neutral_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
sam_neutral_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
sam_neutral_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
sam_neutral_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
sam_neutral_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
sam_neutral_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
sam_neutral_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
sam_neutral_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
sam_neutral_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
sam_neutral_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
sam_neutral_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
sam_neutral_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
sam_neutral_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
sam_neutral_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
sam_neutral_158|Does that look good.
sam_neutral_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
sam_neutral_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
sam_neutral_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
sam_neutral_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
sam_neutral_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
sam_neutral_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
sam_neutral_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
sam_neutral_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
sam_neutral_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
sam_neutral_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
sam_neutral_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
sam_neutral_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
sam_neutral_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
sam_neutral_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
sam_neutral_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
sam_neutral_174|They were the presage of storm.
sam_neutral_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
sam_neutral_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
sam_neutral_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
sam_neutral_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
sam_neutral_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
sam_neutral_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
sam_neutral_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
sam_neutral_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
sam_neutral_183|And the air was growing chilly.
sam_neutral_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
sam_neutral_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
sam_neutral_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
sam_neutral_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
sam_neutral_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
sam_neutral_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
sam_neutral_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
sam_neutral_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
sam_neutral_192|He did not rush in.
sam_neutral_193|It was edged with ice.
sam_neutral_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
sam_neutral_195|But a strange thing happened.
sam_neutral_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
sam_neutral_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
sam_neutral_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
sam_neutral_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
sam_neutral_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
sam_neutral_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
sam_neutral_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
sam_neutral_203|They were following the shore of a lake.
sam_neutral_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
sam_neutral_205|From now on we're pals.
sam_neutral_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
sam_neutral_207|How much was it.
sam_neutral_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
sam_neutral_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
sam_neutral_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
sam_neutral_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
sam_neutral_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
sam_neutral_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
sam_neutral_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
sam_neutral_215|They die out of spite.
sam_neutral_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
sam_neutral_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
sam_neutral_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
sam_neutral_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
sam_neutral_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
sam_neutral_222|What part of the United States is your home.
sam_neutral_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
sam_neutral_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
sam_neutral_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
sam_neutral_226|That came before my A B C's.
sam_neutral_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
sam_neutral_228|But it contributed to the smash.
sam_neutral_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
sam_neutral_230|Do you know any good land around here.
sam_neutral_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
sam_neutral_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
sam_neutral_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
sam_neutral_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
sam_neutral_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
sam_neutral_236|Don't you see I hate you.
sam_neutral_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
sam_neutral_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
sam_neutral_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
sam_neutral_240|Wash your hands of me.
sam_neutral_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
sam_neutral_242|I saw it when she rolled.
sam_neutral_243|I only read the quotations.
sam_neutral_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
sam_neutral_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
sam_neutral_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
sam_neutral_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
sam_neutral_248|I had been sad too long already.
sam_neutral_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
sam_neutral_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
sam_neutral_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
sam_neutral_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
sam_neutral_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
sam_neutral_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
sam_neutral_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
sam_neutral_256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
sam_neutral_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
sam_neutral_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
sam_neutral_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
sam_neutral_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
sam_neutral_261|I have been doubly baptized.
sam_neutral_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
sam_neutral_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
sam_neutral_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
sam_neutral_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
sam_neutral_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
sam_neutral_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
sam_neutral_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
sam_neutral_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
sam_neutral_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
sam_neutral_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
sam_neutral_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
sam_neutral_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
sam_neutral_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
sam_neutral_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
sam_neutral_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
sam_neutral_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
sam_neutral_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
sam_neutral_279|She said with chattering teeth.
sam_neutral_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
sam_neutral_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
sam_neutral_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
sam_neutral_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
sam_neutral_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
sam_neutral_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
sam_neutral_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
sam_neutral_287|Keep an eye on him.
sam_neutral_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
sam_neutral_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
sam_neutral_290|One by one the boys were captured.
sam_neutral_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
sam_neutral_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
sam_neutral_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
sam_neutral_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
sam_neutral_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
sam_neutral_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
sam_neutral_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
sam_neutral_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
sam_neutral_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
sam_neutral_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
sam_neutral_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
sam_neutral_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
sam_neutral_304|I graduated last of my class.
sam_neutral_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
sam_neutral_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
sam_neutral_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
sam_neutral_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
sam_neutral_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
sam_neutral_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
sam_neutral_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
sam_neutral_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
sam_neutral_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
sam_neutral_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
sam_neutral_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
sam_neutral_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
sam_neutral_317|He was a wise hyena.
sam_neutral_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
sam_neutral_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
sam_neutral_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
sam_neutral_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
sam_neutral_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
sam_neutral_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
sam_neutral_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
sam_neutral_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
sam_neutral_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
sam_neutral_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
sam_neutral_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
sam_neutral_329|Ah  indeed.
sam_neutral_330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
sam_neutral_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
sam_neutral_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
sam_neutral_333|This is no place for you.
sam_neutral_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
sam_neutral_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
sam_neutral_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
sam_neutral_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
sam_neutral_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
sam_neutral_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
sam_neutral_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
sam_neutral_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
sam_neutral_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
sam_neutral_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
sam_neutral_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
sam_neutral_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
sam_neutral_346|Get down and dig in.
sam_neutral_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
sam_neutral_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
sam_neutral_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
sam_neutral_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
sam_neutral_351|It was more like sugar.
sam_neutral_352|I'm sure going along with you all  Elijah.
sam_neutral_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
sam_neutral_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
sam_neutral_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
sam_neutral_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
sam_neutral_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
sam_neutral_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
sam_neutral_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
sam_neutral_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
sam_neutral_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
sam_neutral_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
sam_neutral_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
sam_neutral_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
sam_neutral_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
sam_neutral_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
sam_neutral_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
sam_neutral_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
sam_neutral_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
sam_neutral_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
sam_neutral_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
sam_neutral_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
sam_neutral_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
sam_neutral_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
sam_neutral_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
sam_neutral_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
sam_neutral_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
sam_neutral_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
sam_neutral_379|How old are you  daddy.
sam_neutral_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
sam_neutral_381|My name's Ferguson.
sam_neutral_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
sam_neutral_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
sam_neutral_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
sam_neutral_385|That's what Carnegie did.
sam_neutral_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
sam_neutral_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
sam_neutral_388|It was my idea to a tee.
sam_neutral_389|Mab  she said.
sam_neutral_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
sam_neutral_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
sam_neutral_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
sam_neutral_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
sam_neutral_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
sam_neutral_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
sam_neutral_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
sam_neutral_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
sam_neutral_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
sam_neutral_399|And here's another idea.
sam_neutral_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
sam_neutral_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
sam_neutral_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
sam_neutral_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
sam_neutral_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
sam_neutral_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
sam_neutral_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
sam_neutral_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
sam_neutral_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
sam_neutral_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
sam_neutral_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
sam_neutral_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
sam_neutral_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
sam_neutral_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
sam_neutral_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
sam_neutral_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
sam_neutral_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
sam_neutral_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
sam_neutral_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
sam_neutral_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
sam_neutral_421|By golly  the boy wins.
sam_neutral_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
sam_neutral_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
sam_neutral_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
sam_neutral_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
sam_neutral_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
sam_neutral_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
sam_neutral_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
sam_neutral_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
sam_neutral_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
sam_neutral_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
sam_neutral_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
sam_neutral_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
sam_neutral_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
sam_neutral_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
sam_neutral_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
sam_neutral_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
sam_neutral_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
sam_neutral_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
sam_neutral_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
sam_neutral_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
sam_neutral_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
sam_neutral_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
sam_neutral_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
sam_neutral_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
sam_neutral_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
sam_neutral_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
sam_neutral_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
sam_neutral_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
sam_neutral_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
sam_neutral_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
sam_neutral_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
sam_neutral_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
sam_neutral_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
sam_neutral_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
sam_neutral_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
sam_neutral_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
sam_neutral_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
sam_neutral_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
sam_neutral_460|I had forgotten their existence.
sam_neutral_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
sam_neutral_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
sam_neutral_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
sam_neutral_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
sam_neutral_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
sam_neutral_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
sam_neutral_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
sam_neutral_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
sam_neutral_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
sam_neutral_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
sam_neutral_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
sam_neutral_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
sam_neutral_473|The night was calm and snowy.
sam_neutral_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
sam_neutral_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
sam_neutral_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
sam_neutral_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
sam_neutral_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
sam_neutral_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
sam_neutral_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
sam_neutral_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
sam_neutral_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
sam_neutral_484|No-sir-ee.
sam_neutral_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
sam_neutral_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
sam_neutral_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
sam_neutral_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
sam_neutral_489|They were artists  not biologists.
sam_neutral_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
sam_neutral_491|And as in denial of guilt  the one-legged boy replied.
sam_neutral_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
sam_neutral_493|The boy  O'Brien  was specially maltreated.
sam_neutral_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
sam_neutral_495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
sam_neutral_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
sam_neutral_497|King took every advantage he knew.
sam_neutral_498|The lines were now very taut.
sam_neutral_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
sam_neutral_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
sam_neutral_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
sam_neutral_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
sam_neutral_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
sam_neutral_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
sam_sleepiness_002|Not at this particular case  Tom  apologized Whittemore.
sam_sleepiness_004|Lord  but I'm glad to see you again  Phil.
sam_sleepiness_005|Will we ever forget it.
sam_sleepiness_006|God bless 'em  I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
sam_sleepiness_007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
sam_sleepiness_008|Gad  your letter came just in time.
sam_sleepiness_009|He turned sharply  and faced Gregson across the table.
sam_sleepiness_010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
sam_sleepiness_011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
sam_sleepiness_012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
sam_sleepiness_013|He was a head shorter than his companion  of almost delicate physique.
sam_sleepiness_014|Now you're coming down to business  Phil  he exclaimed.
sam_sleepiness_015|It's the aurora borealis.
sam_sleepiness_016|There's Fort Churchill  a rifle-shot beyond the ridge  asleep.
sam_sleepiness_017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
sam_sleepiness_018|There was a change now.
sam_sleepiness_019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad  looking for chances.
sam_sleepiness_020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
sam_sleepiness_021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
sam_sleepiness_022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
sam_sleepiness_023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
sam_sleepiness_024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
sam_sleepiness_025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
sam_sleepiness_026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
sam_sleepiness_027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
sam_sleepiness_028|Robbery  bribery  fraud.
sam_sleepiness_029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
sam_sleepiness_030|I had faith in them.
sam_sleepiness_031|They were three hundred yards apart.
sam_sleepiness_032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
sam_sleepiness_033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter  and handed it to Gregson.
sam_sleepiness_034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
sam_sleepiness_035|He stopped  and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
sam_sleepiness_036|She turned in at the hotel.
sam_sleepiness_037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
sam_sleepiness_038|We'll have to watch our chances.
sam_sleepiness_039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
sam_sleepiness_040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
sam_sleepiness_041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
sam_sleepiness_042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
sam_sleepiness_043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
sam_sleepiness_044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
sam_sleepiness_045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
sam_sleepiness_046|The girl faced him  her eyes shining with sudden fear.
sam_sleepiness_047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
sam_sleepiness_048|He looked at the handkerchief more  closely.
sam_sleepiness_049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
sam_sleepiness_050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
sam_sleepiness_051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color  faintly tinted with yellow.
sam_sleepiness_052|It was a curious coincidence.
sam_sleepiness_053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
sam_sleepiness_054|There was nothing on the rock.
sam_sleepiness_055|Philip stood undecided  his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
sam_sleepiness_056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
sam_sleepiness_057|I have no idea  replied Philip.
sam_sleepiness_058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
sam_sleepiness_059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
sam_sleepiness_060|Anyway  no one saw her like that.
sam_sleepiness_061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
sam_sleepiness_062|The men stared into each other's face.
sam_sleepiness_063|Yes  it was a man who asked  a stranger.
sam_sleepiness_064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
sam_sleepiness_065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
sam_sleepiness_066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
sam_sleepiness_067|Surely I will excuse you  she cried.
sam_sleepiness_068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
sam_sleepiness_069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
sam_sleepiness_070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
sam_sleepiness_071|What was the object of your little sensation.
sam_sleepiness_072|But who was Eileen's double.
sam_sleepiness_073|The promoter's eyes were heavy  with little puffy bags under them.
sam_sleepiness_075|There has been a change  she interrupted him.
sam_sleepiness_076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
sam_sleepiness_077|It is the fire  partly  she said.
sam_sleepiness_078|Then  and at supper  he tried to fathom her.
sam_sleepiness_079|It was a large canoe.
sam_sleepiness_080|What if Jeanne failed him.
sam_sleepiness_081|What if she did not come to the rock.
sam_sleepiness_082|His face was streaming with blood.
sam_sleepiness_083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
sam_sleepiness_084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
sam_sleepiness_085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
sam_sleepiness_086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
sam_sleepiness_087|Philip bent lower  and stared into the face of the dead man.
sam_sleepiness_088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded  and resumed his paddling.
sam_sleepiness_089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
sam_sleepiness_090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
sam_sleepiness_091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
sam_sleepiness_092|He went down in midstream  searching the shadows of both shores.
sam_sleepiness_093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
sam_sleepiness_094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
sam_sleepiness_095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
sam_sleepiness_096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
sam_sleepiness_098|Shall I carry you.
sam_sleepiness_099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
sam_sleepiness_100|You must sleep  he urged.
sam_sleepiness_101|You  you would not keep the truth from me.
sam_sleepiness_102|He will follow us soon.
sam_sleepiness_104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
sam_sleepiness_105|Only  it is so wonderful  so almost impossible to believe.
sam_sleepiness_106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
sam_sleepiness_107|If you only could know how I thank you.
sam_sleepiness_108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
sam_sleepiness_109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
sam_sleepiness_110|Much  replied Jeanne  as tersely.
sam_sleepiness_111|Instead  he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
sam_sleepiness_112|He was wounded in the arm.
sam_sleepiness_113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
sam_sleepiness_114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
sam_sleepiness_115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
sam_sleepiness_116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
sam_sleepiness_117|She added  with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
sam_sleepiness_118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
sam_sleepiness_119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
sam_sleepiness_120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
sam_sleepiness_121|They ate dinner at the fifth  and rested for two hours.
sam_sleepiness_122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
sam_sleepiness_123|She had died from cold and starvation.
sam_sleepiness_124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
sam_sleepiness_125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
sam_sleepiness_126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
sam_sleepiness_127|It was a temptation  but he resisted it.
sam_sleepiness_128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
sam_sleepiness_129|Her face was against his breast.
sam_sleepiness_130|She was his now  forever.
sam_sleepiness_131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
sam_sleepiness_132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
sam_sleepiness_133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
sam_sleepiness_134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
sam_sleepiness_135|I am going to surprise father  and you will go with Pierre.
sam_sleepiness_136|About him  everywhere  were the evidences of luxury and of age.
sam_sleepiness_137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
sam_sleepiness_138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
sam_sleepiness_139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
sam_sleepiness_140|Accept a father's blessing  and with it  this.
sam_sleepiness_141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
sam_sleepiness_142|Such things had occurred before  he told Philip.
sam_sleepiness_143|Ah  I had forgotten  he exclaimed.
sam_sleepiness_144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
sam_sleepiness_145|I have to be careful of them  as they tear very easily.
sam_sleepiness_146|Of course  that is uninteresting  she continued.
sam_sleepiness_147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
sam_sleepiness_148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
sam_sleepiness_149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
sam_sleepiness_150|Goodbye  Pierre  he shouted.
sam_sleepiness_151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail  with three weeks to spare.
sam_sleepiness_152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
sam_sleepiness_153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
sam_sleepiness_154|He was smooth-shaven  and his hair and eyes were black.
sam_sleepiness_155|Won't you draw up  gentlemen.
sam_sleepiness_156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
sam_sleepiness_157|He had worshiped her  as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
sam_sleepiness_158|Does that look good.
sam_sleepiness_159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
sam_sleepiness_160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
sam_sleepiness_161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
sam_sleepiness_162|That's the sub-foreman  explained Thorpe.
sam_sleepiness_163|Philip made no effort to follow.
sam_sleepiness_164|He came first a year ago  and revealed himself to Jeanne.
sam_sleepiness_165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
sam_sleepiness_166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
sam_sleepiness_167|I was near the cabin  and saw you.
sam_sleepiness_168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
sam_sleepiness_169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
sam_sleepiness_170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
sam_sleepiness_171|And when you come back in a few days  bring Eileen.
sam_sleepiness_172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
sam_sleepiness_173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
sam_sleepiness_174|They were the presage of storm.
sam_sleepiness_175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
sam_sleepiness_176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
sam_sleepiness_177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
sam_sleepiness_178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
sam_sleepiness_179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear  he said.
sam_sleepiness_180|If not  let's say our prayers and go to bed.
sam_sleepiness_181|So cheer up  and give us your paw.
sam_sleepiness_182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
sam_sleepiness_183|And the air was growing chilly.
sam_sleepiness_184|Don't you see  I'm chewing this thing in two.
sam_sleepiness_185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
sam_sleepiness_186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
sam_sleepiness_187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
sam_sleepiness_188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
sam_sleepiness_189|The big-eyed  clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
sam_sleepiness_190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
sam_sleepiness_191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
sam_sleepiness_192|He did not rush in.
sam_sleepiness_193|It was edged with ice.
sam_sleepiness_194|He drank of the water cautiously.
sam_sleepiness_195|But a strange thing happened.
sam_sleepiness_196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
sam_sleepiness_197|Such a dog the wise driver kills  or turns loose.
sam_sleepiness_198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
sam_sleepiness_199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
sam_sleepiness_200|He leapt again  and the club caught him once more.
sam_sleepiness_201|He cried  and swung the club wildly.
sam_sleepiness_202|She turned  fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
sam_sleepiness_204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
sam_sleepiness_205|From now on we're pals.
sam_sleepiness_206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
sam_sleepiness_207|How much was it.
sam_sleepiness_208|Youth had come back to her  freed from the yoke of oppression.
sam_sleepiness_209|It was not a large lake  and almost round.
sam_sleepiness_210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
sam_sleepiness_211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
sam_sleepiness_212|Fresh cases  still able to walk  they clustered about the spokesman.
sam_sleepiness_213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
sam_sleepiness_214|Besides  he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
sam_sleepiness_215|They die out of spite.
sam_sleepiness_216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
sam_sleepiness_217|Oppressive as the heat had been  it was now even more oppressive.
sam_sleepiness_218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
sam_sleepiness_219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
sam_sleepiness_220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
sam_sleepiness_221|I don't know why you're here at all.
sam_sleepiness_222|What part of the United States is your home.
sam_sleepiness_223|My  I'm almost homesick for it already.
sam_sleepiness_224|She nodded  and her eyes grew soft and moist.
sam_sleepiness_225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
sam_sleepiness_226|That came before my A B C's.
sam_sleepiness_227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
sam_sleepiness_228|But it contributed to the smash.
sam_sleepiness_229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
sam_sleepiness_230|Do you know any good land around here.
sam_sleepiness_231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
sam_sleepiness_232|I cannot follow you  she said.
sam_sleepiness_233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
sam_sleepiness_234|Why  the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
sam_sleepiness_235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
sam_sleepiness_236|Don't you see I hate you.
sam_sleepiness_237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
sam_sleepiness_238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
sam_sleepiness_239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
sam_sleepiness_240|Wash your hands of me.
sam_sleepiness_241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
sam_sleepiness_242|I saw it when she rolled.
sam_sleepiness_243|I only read the quotations.
sam_sleepiness_244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
sam_sleepiness_245|Out of his eighteen hundred  he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
sam_sleepiness_246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
sam_sleepiness_247|They ought to pass here some time today.
sam_sleepiness_248|I had been sad too long already.
sam_sleepiness_249|All eyes  however  were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
sam_sleepiness_250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
sam_sleepiness_251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
sam_sleepiness_252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
sam_sleepiness_253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
sam_sleepiness_254|Straight out they swam  their heads growing smaller and smaller.
sam_sleepiness_255|You won't die of malnutrition  be sure of that.
sam_sleepiness_257|They are coming ashore  whoever they are.
sam_sleepiness_258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
sam_sleepiness_259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
sam_sleepiness_260|Nobody knew his history  they of the Junta least of all.
sam_sleepiness_261|I have been doubly baptized.
sam_sleepiness_262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
sam_sleepiness_263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon  who bowed.
sam_sleepiness_264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out  Captain Young.
sam_sleepiness_265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
sam_sleepiness_266|They handled two men already  both grub-thieves.
sam_sleepiness_267|Eli Harding asked  as Shunk started to follow.
sam_sleepiness_268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
sam_sleepiness_269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
sam_sleepiness_270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
sam_sleepiness_271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
sam_sleepiness_272|You can take a vacation on pay.
sam_sleepiness_273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
sam_sleepiness_274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
sam_sleepiness_275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
sam_sleepiness_276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
sam_sleepiness_277|McCoy found a stifling  poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
sam_sleepiness_278|It would give me nervous prostration.
sam_sleepiness_279|She said with chattering teeth.
sam_sleepiness_280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
sam_sleepiness_281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
sam_sleepiness_282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
sam_sleepiness_283|The woman in you is only incidental  accidental  and irrelevant.
sam_sleepiness_284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
sam_sleepiness_285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
sam_sleepiness_286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
sam_sleepiness_288|Those are my oysters  he said at last.
sam_sleepiness_289|They are not regular oyster pirates  Nicholas continued.
sam_sleepiness_290|One by one the boys were captured.
sam_sleepiness_291|The weeks had gone by  and no overt acts had been attempted.
sam_sleepiness_292|Here  in the midmorning  the first casualty occurred.
sam_sleepiness_293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
sam_sleepiness_294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
sam_sleepiness_295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
sam_sleepiness_296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
sam_sleepiness_297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
sam_sleepiness_298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
sam_sleepiness_299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
sam_sleepiness_300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
sam_sleepiness_301|But all my dreams violated this law.
sam_sleepiness_302|It is very plausible to such people  a most convincing hypothesis.
sam_sleepiness_303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
sam_sleepiness_304|I graduated last of my class.
sam_sleepiness_305|They had no fixed values  to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
sam_sleepiness_306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
sam_sleepiness_307|Very early in my life  I separated from my mother.
sam_sleepiness_308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
sam_sleepiness_309|White Leghorns  said Mrs Mortimer.
sam_sleepiness_310|Massage under tension  was the cryptic reply.
sam_sleepiness_311|Therefore  hurrah for the game.
sam_sleepiness_312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
sam_sleepiness_313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
sam_sleepiness_314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
sam_sleepiness_315|Saxon waited  for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
sam_sleepiness_316|We had been chased by them ourselves  more than once.
sam_sleepiness_317|He was a wise hyena.
sam_sleepiness_318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
sam_sleepiness_319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says  with editorial gloom.
sam_sleepiness_320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
sam_sleepiness_321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
sam_sleepiness_322|This is a common experience with all of us.
sam_sleepiness_323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
sam_sleepiness_324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
sam_sleepiness_325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
sam_sleepiness_326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
sam_sleepiness_327|They were less stooped than we  less springy in their movements.
sam_sleepiness_328|The Fire People  like ourselves  lived in caves.
sam_sleepiness_329|Ah  indeed.
sam_sleepiness_331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
sam_sleepiness_332|Unconsciously  our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
sam_sleepiness_333|This is no place for you.
sam_sleepiness_334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
sam_sleepiness_335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
sam_sleepiness_336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
sam_sleepiness_337|Encouraged by my conduct  Big-Face became a sudden ally.
sam_sleepiness_338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
sam_sleepiness_339|They obeyed him  and went here and there at his commands.
sam_sleepiness_340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
sam_sleepiness_341|Why  doggone you all  shake again.
sam_sleepiness_342|Seventeen  no  eighteen days ago.
sam_sleepiness_343|You mean for this State  General  Alberta.
sam_sleepiness_344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
sam_sleepiness_345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
sam_sleepiness_346|Get down and dig in.
sam_sleepiness_347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
sam_sleepiness_348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
sam_sleepiness_349|It was simple  in its way  and no virtue of his.
sam_sleepiness_350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
sam_sleepiness_351|It was more like sugar.
sam_sleepiness_353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
sam_sleepiness_354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
sam_sleepiness_355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
sam_sleepiness_356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
sam_sleepiness_357|A month passed by  and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
sam_sleepiness_358|They continued valiantly to lie  but the truth continued to outrun them.
sam_sleepiness_359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
sam_sleepiness_360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
sam_sleepiness_361|But he did not broach it  preferring to mature it carefully.
sam_sleepiness_362|Nope  not the slightest idea.
sam_sleepiness_363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
sam_sleepiness_364|We have plenty of capital ourselves  and yet we want more.
sam_sleepiness_365|These rumors may even originate with us.
sam_sleepiness_366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
sam_sleepiness_367|There is not an iota of truth in it  certainly not.
sam_sleepiness_368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
sam_sleepiness_369|In partnership with Daylight  the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
sam_sleepiness_370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
sam_sleepiness_371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
sam_sleepiness_372|He saw only the effect in a general  sketchy way.
sam_sleepiness_373|Points of view  new ideas  life.
sam_sleepiness_374|But life's worth more than cash  she argued.
sam_sleepiness_375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
sam_sleepiness_376|Your price  my son  is just about thirty per week.
sam_sleepiness_377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
sam_sleepiness_378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
sam_sleepiness_379|How old are you  daddy.
sam_sleepiness_380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
sam_sleepiness_381|My name's Ferguson.
sam_sleepiness_382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
sam_sleepiness_383|To his surprise  her answer was flat and uncompromising.
sam_sleepiness_384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
sam_sleepiness_385|That's what Carnegie did.
sam_sleepiness_386|I can't argue with you  and you know that.
sam_sleepiness_387|Bob  growing disgusted  turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
sam_sleepiness_388|It was my idea to a tee.
sam_sleepiness_389|Mab  she said.
sam_sleepiness_390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
sam_sleepiness_391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
sam_sleepiness_392|There is that magnificent Bob  eating his head off in the stable.
sam_sleepiness_393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
sam_sleepiness_394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
sam_sleepiness_395|As for himself  weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
sam_sleepiness_396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
sam_sleepiness_397|Call me that again  he murmured ecstatically.
sam_sleepiness_398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison  while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
sam_sleepiness_399|And here's another idea.
sam_sleepiness_400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
sam_sleepiness_401|The man smiled grimly  and brought a hatchet and a club.
sam_sleepiness_402|Curly rushed her antagonist  who struck again and leaped aside.
sam_sleepiness_403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
sam_sleepiness_404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
sam_sleepiness_405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
sam_sleepiness_406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
sam_sleepiness_407|Mercedes screamed  cried  laughed  and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
sam_sleepiness_408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
sam_sleepiness_409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
sam_sleepiness_410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
sam_sleepiness_411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
sam_sleepiness_412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
sam_sleepiness_413|But I am at the end of my resources.
sam_sleepiness_414|Now our figuring was all right.
sam_sleepiness_415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
sam_sleepiness_416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
sam_sleepiness_417|It is also an insidious  deceitful sun.
sam_sleepiness_418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
sam_sleepiness_419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
sam_sleepiness_420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
sam_sleepiness_421|By golly  the boy wins.
sam_sleepiness_422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
sam_sleepiness_423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
sam_sleepiness_424|Obviously  it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
sam_sleepiness_425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
sam_sleepiness_426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
sam_sleepiness_427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
sam_sleepiness_428|It was not exactly a deportation.
sam_sleepiness_429|Quick was the disappointment in his face  yet smiling was the acquiescence.
sam_sleepiness_430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
sam_sleepiness_431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
sam_sleepiness_432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
sam_sleepiness_433|To her the bridge was tambo  which is the native for taboo.
sam_sleepiness_434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
sam_sleepiness_435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
sam_sleepiness_436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
sam_sleepiness_437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
sam_sleepiness_438|At sea  Monday  March 16  1908.
sam_sleepiness_439|At sea  Wednesday  March 18  1908.
sam_sleepiness_440|Yes  sir  I corrected.
sam_sleepiness_441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
sam_sleepiness_442|You live on an income which your father earned.
sam_sleepiness_443|He was worth nothing to the world.
sam_sleepiness_444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
sam_sleepiness_445|The creative joy  I murmured.
sam_sleepiness_446|He deluged me  overwhelmed me with argument.
sam_sleepiness_447|Ah  it is growing dark and darker.
sam_sleepiness_448|I was Hump  cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
sam_sleepiness_449|A sinewy hand  dripping with water  was clutching the rail.
sam_sleepiness_450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
sam_sleepiness_451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
sam_sleepiness_452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer  was his greeting.
sam_sleepiness_453|Eighteen hundred  he calculated.
sam_sleepiness_454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
sam_sleepiness_455|I obeyed  and a minute or two later they stood before him.
sam_sleepiness_456|But it won't continue  she said with easy confidence.
sam_sleepiness_457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
sam_sleepiness_458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
sam_sleepiness_459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
sam_sleepiness_460|I had forgotten their existence.
sam_sleepiness_461|Ah  we were very close together in that moment.
sam_sleepiness_462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
sam_sleepiness_463|They are his tongue  by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
sam_sleepiness_464|Between the rush of the cascades  streaks of rust showed everywhere.
sam_sleepiness_465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
sam_sleepiness_466|Captain West may be a Samurai  but he is also human.
sam_sleepiness_467|And so early in the voyage  too.
sam_sleepiness_468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
sam_sleepiness_469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
sam_sleepiness_470|He spat it out like so much venom.
sam_sleepiness_471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
sam_sleepiness_472|He is too keenly intelligent  too sharply sensitive  successfully to endure.
sam_sleepiness_473|The night was calm and snowy.
sam_sleepiness_474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
sam_sleepiness_475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side  and he paused.
sam_sleepiness_476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
sam_sleepiness_477|Wada  Louis  and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
sam_sleepiness_478|Also  she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
sam_sleepiness_479|I tried to read George Moore last night  and was dreadfully bored.
sam_sleepiness_480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
sam_sleepiness_481|Nimrod replied  with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
sam_sleepiness_482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
sam_sleepiness_483|Beyond dispute  Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
sam_sleepiness_484|No-sir-ee.
sam_sleepiness_485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
sam_sleepiness_486|For the rest  he was a mere automaton.
sam_sleepiness_487|The river bared its bosom  and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
sam_sleepiness_488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
sam_sleepiness_489|They were artists  not biologists.
sam_sleepiness_490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
sam_sleepiness_491|And as in denial of guilt  the one-legged boy replied.
sam_sleepiness_492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
sam_sleepiness_493|The boy  O'Brien  was specially maltreated.
sam_sleepiness_494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
sam_sleepiness_495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
sam_sleepiness_496|And Tom King patiently endured.
sam_sleepiness_497|King took every advantage he knew.
sam_sleepiness_498|The lines were now very taut.
sam_sleepiness_499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
sam_sleepiness_500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
sam_sleepiness_501|You're joking me  sir  the other managed to articulate.
sam_sleepiness_502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
sam_sleepiness_503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
sam_sleepiness_504|He was an athlete and a giant.
